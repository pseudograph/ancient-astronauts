ANCIENT ASTRONAUTS

ALICE

MÖBIUS

I was a speck of metal lost in a galactic ocean. Beyond this window lay space unbound. There was neither light nor air nor life save for myself. There were, however, stars strewn across the void, observing my voyage with cold intent.

My warm breath fogged up the window, frozen against the sub-zero temperatures just inches away. I wiped it clean with a silken sleeve, sharpening my reflection: black hair made long and unruly by an eternity in cryosleep, and a still blue lake in each eye. No doubt these eyes had been forgotten by a world long since extinct. My memory being the blank slate that it was gave me no right to complain. All I could do was do their—no, our—memories justice, wherever they may be recorded. All I knew was to live biologically as a human would, and the message installed into me when I wakened:

_Search for a new home to replace the one we razed._

_Seed it with life, and watch warmly as they flourish._

_They need no guidance, so let them stumble. They will rise._

_Intervene only once the inevitable comes to pass._

_And finally… act as a beacon. For any passers-by._

_Would you do that for me?_

An odd message, but with the ship’s pre-programmed routines running hiccup-free my mind was free to wander. I tried to locate myself in the context of the blank canvas I was dropped onto like a blob of paint, but it was merely blank and untouched as far as the eye could see. I was alone, with nothing to reach out and grasp, with a heart mute and devoid of colour—one that beat and breathed against my breast, but with nobody to rest their head against it. A truly inconsequential existence, given form and function by a race long since turned to dust. 

“Aligning for final approach. Begin landing preparations immediately,” warned a routine I had affectionately nicknamed Oracle, reminding me of my purpose. The ship pitched gently. I made my way towards the bow, taking care not to bump into the instruments mounted to the walls.

An ageing but nonetheless secure bulkhead opened as I approached, permitting me into the cockpit. Its size befit my station as a lone pilot: claustrophobic with panels on all sides within arm’s reach, and just large enough to serve as my coffin if things went awry. The thought did not frighten me—I had no concept of death and the fear it entails. Through the narrow windshield I could see a vast blue sphere streaked with wisps of white and masses of brown. This was the planet Oracle had deemed most suitable for life, and it was on this planet that we would live once more.

However, the time I spent in cryosleep had eroded my memories to nothing. The instructions burned into my mind did nothing to assuage my foetal anxiety at drawing my first breaths outside this womb of metal. I strapped myself into the seat and lowered the harness. The planet’s colossal size bore down on me as Oracle guided the ship into the atmosphere.

_This planet looked small enough to fit in my palm earlier, but now it spans the entire windshield. It’s suffocating, as though it’s strapped to my back, its weight threatening to crush me. I honestly can’t remember what mine looked like, or anyone I knew…_

_I wonder… if my home was this large too. How much of it did I see before I left? It might not exist anymore. _

To forget the dead is to kill them a second time—thus, I have committed mass genocide.

 

A billion grey, faceless figures swirled around me, rushing in all directions with the roar of a thousand trains at full tilt; travelling endlessly, as though on tracks chained together in a loop. Their collective howls of agony long muzzled by the sands of time pierced the air, finally given form after who knows how long. Their anguish drew me in and threatened to drown me in guilt. There was no message in their madness. They had neither demands nor curses. All that remained was the pure, unadulterated despair of souls forgotten and left to languish out of sight and out of mind—until now.

Save for one, with a face identical to mine. She reached out through the frigid storm, her tender arms coiling around my body, drawing me into a tight embrace. Our cheeks touched, and my face sank into her hair. My frozen soul thawed and flowed at her warmth, and my eyes ran over. I was of no mind to question her motives or existence.

All I could do was hold on to her for dear life, my limbs entangled with hers. In the bowels of the universe, where no light dared to shine, to be seen in the eyes of another was more than I deserved.

“...”

Her voice! It cut through the pandemonium, sharp and clear as water wrought into glass—yet disfigured beyond recognition in a tongue I did not speak. But before I could draw breath to answer, she was ripped away from me. The shadows blinked into thin air and extreme g-forces shoved me back into my seat.

The ship shook violently, its reinforced belly burning through the thick atmosphere. Wind whipped past, roaring in protest against our intrusion. Even the slightest structural fault would put us at its mercy. My vision rattled, but I kept my eyes open—I was not ready to see darkness again just yet. I resolved to sear the sight of this planet into my mind.

The windshield turned white, blanketed by clouds. The severe deceleration anchored me in place, draining blood from my eyes. I struggled to shake off the gentle shadow smothering my sight, but an invisible hand pinned my neck in place, ready to strangle me at any moment. As I teetered on the precipice of consciousness, the clouds disappeared and gave way to a monochrome world beneath.

Oracle engaged the VTOL thrusters to slow our rate of descent, and colour gradually returned to my eyes. I gasped and sputtered for life, struggling to regain my bearings. The cockpit felt oppressive and hostile all of a sudden.

“Oracle, draw the blinds!”

“At once.”

The hull above and below the windshield retracted, revealing reinforced glass panels, expanding my field of vision. Beneath me stretched a deep shade of blue, stained slightly indigo by the night sky: a vast, undisturbed lake that mirrored the heavens above. The moon stared back at me, resting peacefully upon the water’s surface. It gave chase as I flew past it. Mountains stood guard in the distance, their frosted peaks reaching into the clouds. The sandy shore quickly gave way to rolling fields of long, blue grass.

_Is anyone out there? Is anyone watching, as I make my descent? _

_It’s been so, so long… So long that I cannot remember how long it’s been. So long since I last met a living being. I don’t remember anything, but the passage of time… it leaves scars._

I drank deep of the scenery that wrapped around me, intoxicated by its scale. It wrapped around me, stretching into the horizon and beyond with such beauty that it could not possibly have been wrought by anything other than a loving, omnipotent hand. It numbed, if even just for a moment, the mortal anxiety that plagued my every limb; the fear at breaching the safety of this hull. If this abode amongst the stars truly was the result of chance—then there must be nobody luckier than I. Would that I were someone more eager to set foot on it. 

The ship slowed down, quelling the wind and its fury. All that remained was the coil whine of the ramjets as they spun down, and the whirring of the thruster gimbals gently manoeuvring the ship towards a clearing.

_It’s like I’m the only one left. Alone on a strange planet, forsaken even by my own memory, but not yet by my body. Nobody to hold me accountable. Nobody to be responsible for. It would have been trivial to disable Oracle and go back into cryosleep, leaving the ship to drift idle until our collective demise._

“This looks like a good spot. Beginning vertical descent.” Oracle’s uncannily human voice snapped me out of my reverie, but only for a moment. The gentle, almost motherly trajectory of the ship lulled me into a fading vignette of a memory. Large, motherly hands I put my unconditional trust in held my tiny body whole, lowering me slowly into something warm and soft.

_And yet, I feel the invisible strings of fate. I cannot fathom how far they span, or how long they have guided me here… but without them, I might have chosen death instead._

Under Oracle’s guidance, the ship lowered steadily towards ground zero: our new home. A beautiful home, pure and unspoiled by intelligent life. As a habitable planet, surely it must have been home to some sort of primitive, perhaps microbiological life, but none capable of seeing me as anything other than a force of nature. A falling meteorite rather than a soul. Or perhaps they were unable to see me at all.

I began to cry.

_Perhaps this is telling of my weak, feeble heart, but… mine is one that cannot beat alone._

DIALOGUE

Let me tell you a story that stretches beyond the horizon both ways. A story that begets all other stories, starting from when the pages of time were blank, unblemished and pure. A pen leadened by the weight of a thousand thousand worlds swings down and blots the origin whence rushes out the universe. Countless galaxies stretch and warp across the great boundaries of all that there is; virgin stardust swirling and coagulating within each one. 

_Where were we, then?_

As space begins its flow from mountains on high, so does time. Of the many miracles time’s perpetual march wrought, life is its most magnificent, but also its most ephemeral.

Life gives stardust warmth. Blesses upon it love and grief. Arms it with intelligence, and the means to act. And curses upon it mortality. It is a short respite from the still silence of the cosmos; a blip on the chronology of all that there is. We live like bubbles in the wake, surfacing momentarily only to dissipate once more into the tide.

_So where are we, now?_

To exist without purpose is a burden no soul can bear. It dulls the mind and grinds us down to dust. Perhaps this is why life does not spring eternal; could it be, then, that the desire to live beyond death is what romances the mind more than life itself? A limerence that burns the wick completely, targeted at its bearer. 

The universe permits that much; for the dust that forms us never disappears. It may transmute, relocate, or lay dormant for unspeakably long, but it can always construct and reconstruct life once more.

_And where will we cross paths next?_

All that remains is for us to find our way. Even as my body is ground and dissolved in the frozen dark—even as I wander blind through the storm—my remains shall find their way to you eventually.

_I need no compass for I have faith. _

_I need no vessel for I have time._

_If not in this life, then the next._

_And if not in the next, I will live as long as it takes._

_For if there is one thing that lasts longer than time itself:_

_It is my boundless, eternal love for you._

our corner of the world

“Are you going to drink that?” she asks, her head tilted like a child’s, as she spreads butter onto a slice of bread.

“It’s cold.” My eyes remain glued to the screen.

“That’s perfect,” she chirps as she swipes my cup and gulps my tea down without pause.

“I hate how you always do that. At least microwave it; there’s one right there.”

Clearly, this amuses her. “We are not here to ask questions, my dear child”—her finger wagging, of course—”save for mine! So, let’s hear it. What’s the verdict?”

“Seven ships, a hundred souls aboard each.” I brace for her response—and sure enough, her smile vanishes in an instant.

“That’s far too few. You’d only manage a few colonies per planet. The odds of survival are minimal. You know this!”

“Yes—but that’s all we can do! You know just as well as I do how much power a hundred souls alone would draw. On a ship meant to sustain itself along a trajectory for tens of thousands of years—millions, even!” My breath stifles, but I endure. Confrontation pains me no matter how I try to justify it.

“Yes, I know. I understand it all too well.” She sighs in resignation. “Is there really no other way? No bigger power cells we can use? No unnecessary systems we could remove?”

“No. There is no alternative.”

She brings our cups to the sink to wash them, her back towards me. “I understand. We’ve curated them well. Defects will definitely rise, but they will iron themselves out over time. They might even be better suited to their new environments.

“So, when do we depart?”

“We don’t.”

The sound of clinking teacups stops. She turns off the faucet.

“What?”

“It is as you said. We do not have enough to guarantee genetic diversity. Our ships don’t have the power. The seedships are one-way tickets to certain annihilation. We may live, but only for a short while until genetics catches up.”

My words are frozen in mid-air, seemingly unable to reach her. A ramjet engine whirs to life in the distance, and two more scream past from above the clouds. After a long pause, she turns back to me.

“Sorry. I was waiting for the engines to die down.” The tears lining her cheeks, however, prelude the words she spills immediately after—”I don’t want to give up. Why are you so comfortable with this?”

I steel my heart. “I gave up a long time ago. All I had to do was wait for the world to catch up.”

An array of displays broadcasts our planet on fire. Carnage has torn it apart, razing nearly every square inch of it to ashes and radioactive waste. A paradise lost by our own hands. The age-old question of what the Great Filter could be has finally been answered in the worst way possible: through example. A planet with finite resources, predated by a species unable to see past their own looming deaths is nothing more than a ticking time-bomb, its fuse lit the moment we first drew breath.

“There is nothing human about that response.”

“Is there anything human about what you’re seeing right now? About what we’ve done to ourselves?”

“It is monstrous, yes. But that monstrosity is also part of being human. There is nothing inherently good about us.”

I clenched my fists. “How pretentious. Even now, in one of the last few corners of our world still standing, you patronise me with such rubbish. The very monstrosity you speak of has taken the lives of billions. Can you repeat what you’ve said to the dead lying burnt and dismembered in the ground?”

“Everything you say is true. We destroy. It is in our nature. But it is also in our nature to protect what we hold dear.”

“That is not a privilege we deserve… we are standing on the corpses of an entire planet.”

“It is not a privilege. It is a reflex. An act of survival. To preserve ourselves and the ones we love. Do you think the burnt and dismembered offered themselves as sacrifice willingly? They died after exhausting every option available to them. It is the height of arrogance to absolve yourself of that same duty towards yourself.

“Even if what you say is true, we are doomed to certain death if we do not leave. I don’t want that. I want us to depart and gamble on what little odds we have.”

I can endure this humiliation no longer. “How monstrous… to say something like that as someone as fortunate as you are! Do you realise just how lucky we are to be here? Here, in this room, alive? A gamble, really—to make a journey into interstellar space aboard a spaceship! A gamble barred to all save for a handful! For us! If this is what you call humanity, I want no part of it. Our extinction will be doing the universe a favour!” Tears flow from my eyes as I choke on my breath.

_Stop! I can’t… why…? I’m not a bawling child any longer, so why?_

“I am flattered that you think me fortunate, but if you think luck is a sin, pick up that knife and slit your throat immediately.”

A feverish rage propels me towards the counter, my vision blurring beneath my tears. It leaves as quickly as it manifested, leaving me at a loss for words, with a butter knife in my hands.

_This wouldn’t be sharp enough to kill me even if I tried._

The knife clatters against the floor, basking mockingly in the shadows cast by my limp, cowardly hands.

The tides within me rise and fall, overflowing from my eyes each time, pulling my breath away with it. I can’t see—I must have brought my hands to my face at some point—and my knees begin to give way. 

I fall into her tight embrace. Our cheeks touch, and my face sinks into her hair, staining it with her tears. Basking in the warmth of her love, I sob freely.

An eternity passes before she speaks. “How do you feel?”

“Better.”

“You don’t look like it.”

I forced a weak smile. 

“Far be it from me to presume to understand our race, but I’m sure you can acknowledge that there’s something that separates humans from dust and ash.” I struggle to breathe as she tightens her embrace around me, but I cannot bring myself to reject her. “It drives us to not slit our throats with butter knives. And it drives us to not just protect but also comfort those we love. A chance at self-preservation is the only right we have. 

“We hug each other like this every day. Well, maybe not us specifically, but other people. And many of them die shortly after. We’re lucky to be alive. I’d like for that luck to hold. A childishly simple sentiment, but I hope it’s one we share.”

Emotion stirs within me, but not the type to make me heave and sputter in pain. It feels warm and soft. I yearn for it, and cannot imagine going without it. I repress memories of its absence threatening to boil over. I blind myself to everything but her. Part of me feels stupid for doing so; nothing she’s saying contradicts anything I said. But she’s not trying to. 

Hers is a love that is neither logical nor justifiable. Hers is not an ideology to slave for; nor is it one that is peer-reviewed, cross-checked and proven true under objective scrutiny. It is nothing but balm for my bleeding, rotten heart. And I crave it. Is that a sin? If it is, then I shall bear this cross, no matter how heavy.

“I know what you’re thinking. That it doesn’t matter either way. Whether we die here or not, our time together is finite. We will be aeons apart, both in time and space. But I assure you that I will live as long as it takes to chart those waters that may stand between us.

“I will make that crossing in search of you. I will find my way to you, wherever you are. I will live, and I swear it with all my heart. I expect the same of you—for there are no waters to chart in death.

“You are my world. You keep me human. So promise me never to pull a knife on yourself again, no matter how blunt. Would you do that for me?”

I cannot respond. _How can I even compare to the radiance of her soul? I don’t care anymore about… what was it? Being human… I don’t care. I want to burn for her as brightly as she does for me. I want to promise her what she promises me. _

Still, I am unable to respond.

“It’s okay. Take all the time you need.”

_No… time is not a luxury we have. But if the divine powers that be are watching—or if anyone is, really, anyone at all—please grant me a fraction of a life longer. Just a bit more time is all I need. I will not send her out into the cold expanse with words left unspoken: this I swear._

_But for now… I wish to hug her a little longer. So my heart may not beat alone._

ALICE

JOURNEY’S END

It was a long, arduous process. Twenty years for the foetuses to incubate and be memory-written. A few months for Oracle to seed them in groups across the planet in reasonably habitable climates; humans function best in small clans. They adapted quickly to their new world, as expected. After establishing primitive cave-dwellings and learning to hunt with whatever they had on hand, I descended upon each settlement to show them fire. Then, tools of stone. And finally, the wheel. All within a week. 

They spoke no intelligible tongue, but the sheen of my ship’s overengineered hull stunned them into submission. This was a marvellous planet teeming with life, located right within the Goldilocks zone of its host star. The neo-humans, who saw me and my ship as some sort of supernatural presence, made good use of my gifts and flourished as we must have once did on a barren planet countless light years away. From caves they progressed to huts, and from huts to hamlets, and from hamlets to towns. Life, in its entirety, was going smoothly.

“I do,” the couple said in unison, basked in light made holy by the stained-glass window it filtered through. They leaned into an embrace and kissed, drawing scattered applause from the pews. It echoed through the cathedral, growing louder and more raucous and coloured with laughter, the air swelling with the same joy that yearned to burst out of the hearts of both groom and bride. 

I gazed upon this precious sight from a mezzanine far above them. Not too long before, I realised something. Despite how far they had progressed technologically their savagery still showed in how they loved: in a manner devoid of love. I took it upon myself to teach them not just to love but also the courage to do so, hoping that it would drive them forward as relentlessly as it did my people. Thankfully, Oracle still had memories of the past—a Golden Record of sorts—that I used both as reference and for my own education. I could not help but to create this world in the image of the one I had lost.

This was the first marriage to occur on this planet, and in grand fashion. How lucky! Many would follow. In time they would learn to love and seek love from each other rather than my holy, sporadic presence. I could not watch over them forever, and so I did not. There was neither fanfare nor ceremony to mark my departure; they were far too busy. While there still were starry-eyed pioneers amongst them with their eyes cast permanently heavensward, many looked now towards their immediate family, occupied with providing for them and basking in their love.

The sun began to retreat below the horizon, painting the sky scarlet and the streets with shadows. Cosy cottages lining the streets lit up one by one with the soft glow of candlelight filtering through their windows. Lazy trails of smoke wafted from chimneys. The bustling afternoon streets had fallen still save for a few roaming packs of children daring to play past dinnertime. This was a town of peace and harmony, of warm homes and warm food, wishing only for their happiness to last. 

There was no room for me here, with an appearance and disposition identical to the mythical angel they painted on their stained-glass windows. There was no need to redirect their love. And so I took up abode in a nearby mountain range. A vast cave system had formed here quite conveniently, with space even for me to land my seedship in a cleverly obscured clearing. 

I lay on the bluegrass outside, Oracle’s spherical, metallic form hovering beside me. 

“We did well, don’t you think?” My eyes gaze at the stars. _Despite how much this planet’s changed, they haven’t moved a bit._

“Indeed. Humanity has been granted another chance. They will flourish just as before, barring any potential unfortunately timed asteroid-related incidents.”

“Right. Surely you can use the seedship to knock one off course? Hypothetically, of course. I would never put you in harm’s way.”

“No, I do believe you would put me in harm’s way if given the chance. Regardless, a seedship would have no effect on its trajectory, assuming it was big enough to pose a significant threat to this planet.”

“Then… start praying, Oracle. I will too.”

“You are this planet’s resident deity. To them, there is no higher authority. Perhaps they should be praying instead.”

“But I can’t stop an asteroid!”

“A shame.”

I had grown used to these conversations with him. Her? I wasn’t sure. Oracle had an ambiguous voice. Almost like he was both but neither at the same time. Either way, I often asked him about my old world. Asking Oracle questions was an art in itself; he would answer what was asked of him and offer no further details or context. _After all, he isn’t human. But lately, it seems like I’ve been rubbing off on him. His “humanity” might just be a superficial imitation of my affect, but it’s a lot less lonely to deal with. That’s nice. I can live with that. But what now?_

I think back to the message I heard an eternity past, when I drew breath for the first time. _When the inevitable comes to pass…_

“Oracle.”

“Yes?”

“Show me the end of my world.”

luck

We are due to depart in three days. The seedships are an engineering marvel: nearly self-sufficient even in transit and at full load, with the caveat of only a hundred souls aboard each one. Still an impressive feat. One hundred foetuses cryonically preserved in pods that would take their first steps on an alien planet lie in my hands, their fates dependent on the course I would chart.

“Two hundred light-years? That’s suicide.” Her displeasure showed clearly on her face.

“So is every other option. Look, someone has to draw the short straw. We’re out of options here; these two are the only ones left. Seems like you don’t like this one, so I’ll take it. You can chart a course for… wait, they’re both equally far away. Want to flip a coin?”

Her displeasure turns into disbelief. “I suppose we’ll be in cold sleep for most of it, and the ships should be able to hold out even on autopilot, so…”

“Being at the mercy of space debris for two light centuries is no joke. I’ll be honest with you: chances are high that the two of us will end up minced into space dust by asteroids, floating in orbit somewhere for billions of years, waiting for the Big Crunch to give us another chance. You’re betting against insurmountable odds.”

“When you put it that way, taking our chances here on Earth doesn’t sound too bad. Hypothetically.”

I sip my tea. “Maybe. I’d rather die frozen asleep than to be burned to death. What do you think?” I reach for a shaker and sprinkle more sugar into my cup. I did not, in my nonchalance, presume to be above the catastrophe that had befallen our planet, as though it were none of my concern. I had simply fostered a desire to tour the tiny slice of the world we had to ourselves before leaving in a desperate attempt to burn it into my memory.

She sits there as motionless as the cup of tea I brewed for her, untouched. The choice I offered her was simple: to burn in the flames before her or to jump out the window behind her in the hope that something would break her fall. I pray we are the last to ever have to consider such a choice.

“Whatever. I’ll take it. This is what I signed up for. I’ll do it—I’ll fly [Möbius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip) to whatever’s left and reseed it. You can take either. Flip a coin if you want.”

She gulps her lukewarm tea as though it were medicine before slamming her cup down against the table. I click my tongue, but say nothing. They say that memories are associated with smell and taste stronger than anything else. I wish she’d savour my tea a little longer—I want to burn myself whole into her memory through any means possible. Part of me even hopes she will regret not taking her time drinking it somewhere down the line, when we are galaxies apart. How childish of me. Of course, I do not want her to drown in that regret, forever gasping at the surface for reprieve. I simply hope for a hairline crack on her glass heart: one that aches pleasantly like a sore muscle; one that spurs her eyes towards me wherever I may be; one that, in time, she will patch over with memories forged and reforged; but one that will never heal. I hope my presence by her side will anguish her so. Is that wrong of me? Is it a sin to harbour that bit of selfishness within me?

If so, I accept any retribution I deserve. It is a small price to pay to reserve part of her mind for myself, even when we find ourselves separated by not just hundreds of light-years but possibly even the border between life and death. I pull a coin out of my pocket.

“I thought you were joking.”

I can’t possibly tell her the reason why. Life is possible on both choices, but one more likely than the other. How can two planets possibly be the same? Duplicates cannot be part of God’s design. Part of me wants to grant her the more optimistic planet, and part of me wanted it for myself. A simple yet unforgivable dilemma; yet if I were to say it out loud, she would no doubt laugh and call me “human”. Anyone in my place would feel the same; I just happened to be last in line with nobody behind me to take my place. It is not my role to weigh our souls and the souls of everyone on board our respective seedships. So whose is it, then? Who has the authority to judge these scales?

“I’m feeling lucky today.”

REFUGE

I did not count the days that passed. I gauged the passage of time by observing your progress. Your world had advanced into what I could only describe as a Mediaeval-Industrial Age. Your people thrived in the face of disease and famine, progressing at a steady pace. It truly was an Age that beckoned to its people: those that yearned to build became engineers and architects, devising all sorts of brilliant devices and building monuments that emboldened your eyes ever higher. Those that yearned to save lives did so through medicine, selflessly toiling to find cures and treat the sick and dying; in most cases, to extend their lives, while in others, to help them pass on in peace. Those that yearned for blood slaughtered in battle, feeding an endless meat-grinder in defence of their territory or to occupy other lands. Those that gazed beyond the horizon sailed into the great unknown in search of distant lands—some never to return. And those that aspired towards nothing at all found their roles in creating warm homes and cooking meals with love for their heroes to return to. The clarion call blared endlessly as your people continued to live however they deemed fit. 

Then there were those who fell through the cracks. You, who showed up at my unsuspecting cave one night, dressed only in a ragged cloak white with snow, were one of them. Your eyes burned blue in the night, but your malnourished body was frail against the raging blizzard, on the verge of collapsing.

“You’re… a woman.”

“And you’re a girl. Hello.”

“How can a woman live unmarried on her own in the mountains?”

“That’s funny. I’ll have you know: I am married.”

You seemed wary, but something about my presence made you stay. Or perhaps it was the warmth of the candle in my hand. I extended my free palm to you and managed a smile. You did not return it, but weakly clasped it with your fingers like a child. I was not blind to your age, however. I fancied myself wise enough to be able to tell that we could not have been more than a year apart. Regardless, my abode became your asylum.

“These are the living quarters.”

“It’s a cave with a bed.”

“No, there’s furniture too.”

“You mean that makeshift table? And what’s that under the bed?”

“The dining table, you mean. And Oracle? I’ll introduce you to him soon. Follow me.”

I took your hand, still trembling with cold (or perhaps fear) despite your aloof demeanour, and guided you down the natural hallway that connected the caves.

“This is the study. I will have a bed prepared for you shortly.”

“There’s nothing in here.”

“Well, surely you understand that I cannot house a guest in a room with valuables. If you have any ideas to spruce up the decor, please let me know. As long as they aren’t too expensive. Think of this room as a blank canvas for your taste.”

The look of exasperation on your face was oddly adorable, but the rumble of your stomach immediately after was even more so. 

“I’m sorry. You must be famished. Here, take my cloak—yours isn’t going to do much against a winter as harsh as this. I shall bring you some food.”

As you could tell, my home was spartan. Still, I preferred it over wasting my years away in cryosleep aboard the seedship. This cave could not have been easy to find, with a deceptively hidden entrance—but who was I to argue with the invisible strings of fate that might have led you to this refuge for those without a place in society? Those that made first contact with me all those years ago had long since died. It seemed like my existence had been mythified to the point where someone of my stature would be deemed a blasphemous impostor. Thus, I had decided to live here in solitude, watching over the world as it flourished, hidden from prying eyes.

“Tell me”—I said, after gulping down a bowl of porridge whole—”are you from the nearby town?”

You nodded, your bowl of porridge yet untouched.

“And what brings you here on such a terrible day?”

You stared at something far behind me, though I could not tell what.

“It’s okay. Take all the time you need.”

And you did. Perhaps that was for the best; you were a lot weaker than I had thought, and speaking would have sapped what little energy you had left. You lay in bed for days; not asleep, but unwilling to get up for anything other than meals. While the rations I had in store were… sufficient to sustain life, I thought something more suited to your appetite might help you recover your energy quicker. I foraged for berries and hunted small animals, battling howling winter gales all the while. I tried hunting larger game but gave up after wolves ripped off my left arm. Regenerating it at the seedship’s medical bay was a routine procedure, but not something I wished to experience again. The irony in having to resort to such primal methods in a world that had advanced to such great heights by my guidance was not lost on me. I cared for you not out of sympathy, but simply because I wanted to know what it was about the world I had crafted that shunned her.

“Your name… what’s your name?” You spoke for the first time since our conversation over porridge a week ago. I could barely hear your voice through the thunderstorm that raged outside, painting the ground outside with dirty snow.

“Does it matter? We’re the only ones here. Why don’t you tell me yours? It’s basic courtesy to introduce yourself first, you know?”

“...”

“Nevermind. So, let me ask you again: what brought you here, on a day just as terrible as this one?” I smiled as warmly as I could, hoping to elicit a response.

“I don’t get it. You’re… you’re God, aren’t you? You look exactly like… like… the woman, from back then… and the one on the stained-glass mirror... and… But if you are… Why do you permit me to live?”

I was puzzled. You mistaking me for a deity was not unfounded. Other than my hair being a bit longer than it was, I must resemble the myth precisely. Not that I remembered what I looked like—there were no mirrors in this cave. Perhaps my ascetic means of living gave me some sort of heavenly aura. What I was more concerned about was why she feared for her life in my presence. 

“Elaborate. Why would I have any reason to kill you?”

“I escaped from the chapel. They locked me in there for… I have no idea how long, it must have been weeks. All because…” Your voice faded into quiet sobbing. I wasn’t sure how to react, so I didn’t. I simply waited for you to finish. The passage of time had taken a greater toll on me than I expected; I had no idea how to respond empathetically to such shows of emotion like a human would. There were no clocks here to punctuate the passing of time, but your sobbing worked well enough. You choked on your tears every time thunder struck before proceeding to sob even harder. 

I waited for so long I thought the rain might cease. Eventually, you looked up at me and crawled over to sit by my side. I gazed into your eyes: two turbulent lakes of blue that threatened to spill over again. _How beautiful,_ I thought. _How many centuries have passed since I last peered into my reflection? I scarcely remember the shape of my eyes, but I can almost see them reflected in yours. _There was nobody on this planet further removed from ideals of beauty as an ancient deity such as myself, but even that could not stop me from succumbing to the folly of envy. _How deep and full of life. Someone as young as you could not possibly have seen so much to warrant windows into such a vast abyss. A colour that has chased in my shadow all my life; a shade that evokes nostalgia of events that never came to pass. How do I look? Do I truly fit the image of God? If I do, I swear to offer you salvation beyond my ability, at the cost of all else. _Fleeting emotions, surely—but I grasped them with all my strength. _I am glad. This is the false bravado that humans wield so naturally. The intense, inexplicable desire for one another that drives us. I am still human. _

“I shall tell you my tale from the very beginning. But please… promise me one thing.”

“...”

“Believe me. That is all I ask. For not a single soul has heard this tale and not called me a liar.”

_Interesting. I could say the same about my own tale. Then again, I have never told it to anyone_—_but I am sure it would seem like the ravings of a lunatic._

“I am no stranger to strange tales. I will believe every word you say—this I swear with all my heart.”

“Then… I will begin with the day I first drew breath.”

life springs eternal

I remember little of my past, save for the day I was born. A deafening, monstrous roar like nothing I have heard since filled my ears, unyielding, like a dying monster not of this planet. I felt the floor below me shift and sigh; perhaps I was on a ship sailing the roughest waters known to man. All I could see was pitch black. I was terrified before I even understood the concept of terror. I did not have the words to describe what was happening. I had no frame of reference, but part of me knew that this was not the place for me.

After quite literally a lifetime, the ship stopped. The roar died down and was replaced by a shrill whine. The beast progressed through its final stages of death, until finally all fell silent. Metal struck metal and for the first time in my life, I saw light. Blinding, pure light spilled through a crack in the darkness. It expanded, filling my vision completely, searing my retinas. I wanted the darkness back. The nothingness I felt before felt secure compared to the light. Wind rushed past my face. I smelt the ticklish, minty scent of bluegrass. And as my pupils constricted, I could finally see the world for the first time. 

A field of blue, rolling grass spanned as far as the eye could see. Frost-capped mountains loomed in the distance, piercing into the clouds above. A full moon hung still in the heavens, watching over us with patience. Us… yes, there were others with me. I was in a metallic chamber of sorts, and there were about a dozen or so of us strapped into strange seats. Moments later, the straps released, and many of us flopped onto the floor, having experienced gravity for the first time. I struggled to gain my bearings, and unsteadily rose to my feet. My body was not unlike what it seems to you now. The others; they were fully grown too.

Eventually, one of them, possibly overwhelmed by what was happening, shrieked in terror and scrambled out of the chamber on all fours like an animal. The rest of us immediately followed suit and ran out. Unfamiliar with the sensation of grass and the dirt beneath, many stumbled and fell. As I lay there on the ground, I rolled over and looked towards the ship. It was an abomination that was not a ship at all, and there was no ocean to be seen. It was a gargantuan beast of metal; I can only describe it as such as I have not seen anything like it since. The chamber from which we emerged slid shut its metal doors as quickly as they opened. Purple flames shot out of its wings towards the ground, but oddly the grass did not burn. We backed away in fear, unable to comprehend what we were seeing. And then, the beast did something I have never seen since: it rose into the air. Gently, like a sleeping babe being lifted from its cot by its mother. Vertically, in one smooth, graceful arc. At that moment, I could only describe this winged metal beast as beautiful. The sight of it departing this world must have been the work of God. This glimpse of his awesome power terrified me. I never wanted to bear witness to its beauty ever again. That was the last I ever saw of it.

What happened after that is a blur. We were alive, on a planet supporting life. We knew nothing, but had our instincts to guide us to hunt for food and build shelter. Our first steps on this planet were rough and uncertain, but we had no alternative. We had been dropped into this world with no guidance nor reason to live, but we could not wonder why. That was a privilege reserved for those with full bellies and beds to sleep in. We took each day one after the other, focusing only on the next meal and the threats that might have killed us at any moment. I cannot put into words how existentially terrifying the thought of living meal to meal is in that context. We were not apex predators. We were a link in the food chain, and behaved as such.

Eventually, we found a cave well-concealed from the elements and big enough for us all. We made it our home base. We fashioned rudimentary tools to hunt with, and skinned pelts to clothe ourselves with. Logically, there was no reason for us to stay together, but I suppose instinct guided us to live as a pack. However, there was something about me that was very wrong. If you—God, I mean, could make mistakes—I must be her biggest embarrassment. For I cannot stand the touch of a man.

We were not unlike animals, and we mated in the open as animals did. There was not much else to do for recreation. The cave was big enough for multiple pairs to go at it simultaneously. I recall laying on my sleeping mat, my eyes fixated on a man mounting a woman across from me like a dog. I felt nothing but revulsion at the sight. I was horrified at the prospect of being in her place. I could not bear to look at the flopping genitals of the men that would sometimes walk around naked. It was unbearable. And yet, to the others, it seemed like the most perfectly natural order of things. Men mated with women, and that was that. They felt no shame about the matter, and did as their instincts told them to. I was propositioned for sex many times, and most simply grumbled as I turned them down. There were plenty of other women, after all. One of them, whose face I do not wish to recall, paid no heed to my words and threw me to the ground, his eyes cold and narrow as though looking at prey. I knew immediately that there was no reasoning with such a man, and that to fight back would get me killed. I had seen how savagely animals mated in the wild, and I was reminded that we were no different.

So I sobbed, for there was nothing else I could do. A woman pressed her naked self against him, presumably in an attempt to pull his gaze away from me. His eyes did not budge as he shoved her away from him before pouncing upon and raping me. It was a living hell, and I have never regretted being alive as much as I did in that moment. I screamed and vomited at the horror of it all, but it did nothing to dissuade him. Nobody did anything but watch; perhaps it was hard for them to mate with me yelling in the background. Eventually, he stood up and left. I lay there like a corpse, curled up and unable to breathe. The woman from before knelt by my side and said something, but I neither could nor wanted to hear it. I had lost all distinction of gender; she was a human, and that damned her in my eyes. I despised myself for thinking we were any different from the animals we ate. I felt ashamed of who I was, and for being so weak. If, as a woman, I were fated to be inferior physically, and if despite being a woman I were fated to find men revolting, why was I born as one? I could not fathom why. All I knew was that I no longer had any desire to live; nor did I understand who I was. I did not seek answers. All I sought was the sweet release of death.

I awoke the next day to some commotion outside the cave. It was then that I heard the sound of the beast—the winged, metal one. I was terrified. What now? Was it here to drop another pack of humans to devour both the land and each other? I wanted no part of it. But the rest of us were overtaken by curiosity. They did not share the same fear for humans that I did. They rushed out to greet the beast.

What exactly happened out there—I do not know. I heard the beast’s roar die down like it did before. Then, there was silence from both the beast and our herd. Sounds of metal against metal rang out, and what sounded like tools falling to the ground. Then, the voice of a woman cut through the air—sharp and clear as water wrought into glass. She spoke a tongue I had never heard before. A clamour rose from the herd; some rejoiced, while others asked questions. After what seemed like an unproductive conversation, the herd began to cheer. Shortly after, metal hit metal and the beast roared once more, slowly fading away into the distance. It must have left.

The herd shuffled back into the cave with their heads hung in silence. Why? They were rejoicing just moments ago, but the air had shifted. I looked up, and saw that they were all equipped with tools made of stone, flaming sticks, and wooden wheels. I had never seen any of them before. I did not even think it possible to have fashioned these by hand. One of them—a male—approached me, and for a moment I feared the worst. However, he did not touch me. Instead, he kneeled before me. He held out a sword of stone in his hands. Even without having seen one before, I immediately knew that this was an instrument of death. It was designed to kill.

“You are… descended from the beast. Forgive us.”

He spoke in our crude tongue. The beast? That big, noisy, metal one? Or perhaps he meant the woman? It seemed they could not differentiate between the two, and saw the metal beast as a steed of sorts. To them, the woman was now the beast. It was clear that they called her beast not out of disgust or horror, but with reverence. Their eyes gleamed with awe, and they were directed at me.

“She is no beast,” someone else called out. Murmurs of approval spread throughout the room. They felt dissonance at the use of the word to describe someone so above and beyond their status. I had not even seen her, but I felt her holy presence from the way it had rubbed off on them.

“Then, we need a new word. A name for the gentle woman on her steed who has showered us with her gifts. And her child, who sits before us.”

“God!”

It had a nice ring to it. Murmurs of approval turned to shouts and waving fists of approval. 

“God has graced us! She, who gave us life and a place to live, has descended upon us despite our sins!”

The idea of God had captured the imagination of this disgusting herd of brutes. The idea that their lives had meaning, and that they had the favour of a divine presence was exactly the sort of validation such monsters craved. And yet, the sword presented to me held weight. I understood the gesture.

“Child of God. Forgive us, and accept this gift.”

I held out my hands and gripped the hilt wordlessly. It weighed far more than I expected—the blade pivoted around the pommel and slammed into the floor. A few gasps rang out, but the blade was unharmed. It truly was a fine weapon. I wrestled against it, finally managing to hold it upright. It teetered unsteadily in my hands, but for the first time in my life, I felt some semblance of strength. It was a lean, sharp blade and thinner than I thought. With practice, I would be able to swing it around. I could seize control of my life with that capacity.

I decided never to let this sword go. I did not understand why they thought me the child of God, but I knew better than to ask questions. That night, I silently mouthed words of thanks to the woman—no, God—who had shown up that day. Of course, it was a fleeting moment of elation that someone in the depths of despair such as myself had no choice but to grip onto desperately. I was well aware of what “humans” were like. They had been disciplined by the sight of a superior being, but that was merely a muzzle. A simple gift did nothing to sate my hatred for my race. They were still monsters deep down, created presumably by the hands of God. Who was at fault? Us? Or Her? And was there a monster within me, waiting for an opportunity to be let loose? 

I could not accept that. And so I adopted the mantle they had given me: “child of God”. I resolved to distance myself from them, and live the revered existence they expected of me. I wished to live in solitude, and this title gave me reason to demand that space; to create a divide between me and them. I had to learn to live independently before I could do any of that, however. This sword was merely a single step. Perhaps I could use it to slay rabbits or forage on my own. Eventually, I might be able to hunt larger prey. And with the other stone tools, I could do a lot more. I finally had a light to strive towards.

The next day, the man who raped me lay dismembered in a ditch outside the cave, his body mutilated and carved open by bloodied stone tools (meant for farming) that lay next to his corpse. He had been killed during the night, but we did not know who. The heavy rain must have drowned his screams. Some of us buried him so they would not have to look at his gory corpse any longer. We never spoke of him again; nor did we try to find out who killed him. Everyone agreed that he was a monster that deserved no place in our clan. I had nothing to say on the matter. On one hand, I was content with never having to see him again. On the other hand—despite all the cheer and commotion about gifting me a sword and calling me the child of God and what not—they had taken it upon themselves to eliminate this man, for clearly I was still defenceless and incapable. I felt empty.

Years passed, but I had nothing to show for it. The others wizened and died, but my body remained exactly as it did the day I stepped off the beast. This baffling defect of mine instilled fear and respect in everyone I met. “Child of God,” they would murmur as I walked past, their heads bowed slightly out of fear of making eye contact rather than in deference. So did their children and their grandchildren. My presence was unnatural. An anomaly. Someone to be cast out and worshipped at the same time. I existed above and beyond them, out of sight and out of mind. They were content with merely staying out of my sight; I had no powers of the sort to punish or demand offerings with. I held no influence over the world beyond my improved swordsmanship that I wielded only for food. To be without a place in the world was all I had ever known, and so I decided to leave for a cottage of my own. I lived there undisturbed; though I cannot say how long.

To my regret, mine is a heart that crumbles in the face of time. The seasons turned without end, and my apathy towards humans turned to curiosity. I did not _like_ them, but their progress was undeniable. Even from my cottage I could see the spires of their civilization tower over a land sucked dry, their shadows lengthening with each era that passed by. In comparison, I must have seemed a beast. Perhaps a tour was in order.

“What’ll it be?” bellowed a hulk of a man turned away from me, made more of muscle than anything else. His shoulder blades swivelled as he wiped a glass clean.

_What’ll it be? What are these even supposed to be?_ Glass bottles with all sorts of rancidly hued concoctions—no, _beverages,_ lined the shelves in front of me, glowing warmly under the tavern lamps. I had never seen so much… liquid in one place before. Is this what people drank for sustenance now? Or for pleasure?

“Uh…”

“First time? Just turned of age, did you? No, you’re hardly a lad from the look of you. Then again, I was about your size when I had my first pint—and I did a good job painting the walls that night. Wahahaha!”

His booming voice rattled my skull, but the ruckus that filled the tavern drowned it out. _People are a lot… bigger than I recall. How?_ _Is it because of what they drink? Perhaps I should learn to brew these. _I looked over at the table next to me, where a pair clinked their glasses and gulped them down without hesitation—one nearly twice the size of the other, but only horizontally. _Seems like the effects vary._

“That’s a tiefdraught. Not what I’d propose a toast to, but with where they’re going on the morrow, I can hardly blame ‘em. Want to try one?”

“Ah… sure. Sorry, you’re right—this is my first time.”

“Wahahaha! Written clear as day across your face—anyone could tell! Ah, what I’d give to be in your shoes. Even the harshest brews lose their kick eventually. Well, consider this on the house; after all, it’d be an honour to serve you your first pint. I still remember the first glass my dad poured for me—bless his soul, wherever he is—and nothing’s come close since. A tiefdraught, though… well, no better way than to jump into the deep end, hm?”

_Perhaps this isn’t a great idea._ “What’s a tiefdraught?”

“Delve on the rocks with a dash of Marine Blue, with a hefty mix of pure alcohol. Not the hardest drink to whip up, nor the most expensive, but it packs a punch. Look, we’re almost out of Marine Blue.”

He turned towards me. With two barrels for arms, he deftly poured out a blue reagent into a glass dyed deep indigo by its contents. The blue filtered into the indigo, turning the concoction dark as the ocean floor.

“Is that the last of it?” I looked around, and noticed the sheer number of people toasting to tiefdraughts. “Is this really that good?”

“No, it tastes awful if you ask me.”

“So why’s it so popular? Surely you have other things on the menu.”

His eyes narrowed. “You from across the ocean, lad?”

“What?”

“Hm. Well, I suppose it doesn’t matter. Most of who you see here tonight won’t live to see the sun rise.”

_Huh? What, is this poison?_

“They’re soldiers, to be sortied a few hours from now. Wouldn’t expect you to know that, since clearly you’re not military—but surely you know we’re at war?”

“Um… sorry, you’re right. I’m not from around here.”

“I’m surprised they let you right through the gates. I suppose someone like you doesn’t seem like they’d so much as dare raise a hand against a fly. Then again, some of the gatesmen are in here drinking too, so it’s more than likely they’re beyond caring. Either way, it’s a fact that almost every battalion we send out gets massacred. It’s a bloodbath out there. It’s not like the enemy’s having an easy time of it—we take two along for every one of us that falls—but it’s not a pretty sight. Tomorrow’s said to be the biggest operation there’s been yet, perhaps one that might end the war, but who’s to say?

“Tiefdraught isn’t something you drink alone. Because it tastes like a rotting carcass. It’s something you can only stomach with a friend, a buddy, someone you trust. Think of it this way—if your pal’s not even willing to chug a pint with you, d’you think they’d spare a glance for you on the battlefield? Surely not.

“Well, that’s a bit of lore for you. Y’know, after saying all that, I can’t let you drink this alone, can I? Let me brew another for myself, and we’ll toast.”

_How stupid. Humans haven’t changed a bit. How does anyone here see a point in senseless murder? Is this supposed to be fun? Do they not stop to wonder why this loudmouth gets to sit here singing tales of their deaths without ever having to lift a sword, while they rush to their deaths? _

Of course, I couldn’t say any of that out loud. “Right… sorry, what’s a toast?”

“What? C’mon, does nobody drink where you’re from? It’s when you clink your glasses together before taking a swig. Here, hold your glass out.”

He picked up a tiefdraught of his own and held it out expectantly, a grin across his face. I grasped the handle of my jug—and only then did its weight strike me. _So heavy!_ I squirmed as I lifted the glass with both hands towards his, shaking unsteadily all the while. In comparison, his glass hung still as a rock.

“Wahahaha! Sorry, maybe I should have poured you half a pint instead. Anyhow, here we go—Cheers! To your arrival, child from o’er the horizon!”

I pulled down my scarf and perched the glass against my lips before hesitating. Vapour stung my eyes and filtered into my nose. _I suppose this is something you chug rather than sip._ The bartender had already begun gulping his drink down. Not wanting to be left behind, I closed my eyes, counted to three and tipped the tiefdraught into my mouth almost vertically, letting my hood fall as I did so.

The foam that crested the surface coagulated near my mouth as the draught slowly spread down my throat. It tasted like death: ice-cold and bitter, made of alien waters murky and sterile amidst tall, snowy mountains that stretched into the night; a taste that burned and rose to a searing crescendo and subsided just as I began to choke and my eyes began to water. The boiling depths parted, making way for a haunting aftertaste: earthy but deathly still, missing the heat that threatened to scorch my tongue into glass just moments earlier. The taste left my mouth numb and slid into my throat, staying there like a pocket of phlegm.

_People pay to drink this? I would sooner drink my own piss than another cup of this bile._

I opened my eyes to a world swimming in my tears. I set the cup down on what seemed like the counter and wiped my eyes dry. But before the world came into focus, I realised that something had changed. I probed my senses, trying to identify what; it was not that something had appeared, or made its presence known. Rather, it was the _absence _of something.

_The noise. It’s gone. The ruckus of the bar, the voices, the clinking of glass… everything’s fallen silent._

The bartender’s face finally defined itself in front of me. His face lay twisted into one of awe. Astonishment and a hint of fear had stolen his words as he stood in front of me slack-jawed. I felt a little uncomfortable at his silence; a feeling that doubled into full-blown fear as I looked around the bar. Not a soul moved. Their cups all sat on their tables; some lay shattered against the floor. Their eyes were trained on me, their faces in abject shock just as the bartender’s was.

_What? Did something happen? What the hell… am I seeing things? What was in that drink? _Fear wrapped its tendrils across my heart, threatening to crush it whole. I snapped my head back towards the cup. It looked just as it did before I drank it, just one sip emptier: a deep shade of blue that reflected my countenance perfectly, save for my eyes that blended into the drink’s hue.

“You are… Her, are you not?” Trembling in a way that infected me with his fear, the bartender finally broke the silence.

“Her?”

“Far be it from me to toss my lot in with the likes of angels, but even someone like me had an inkling of who you were the moment you stepped in. Her of eternal life, descended upon her winged chariot… I’ve seen the stained glass window in the chapel. The one that’s been there for centuries. That’s you… surely!”

Murmurs spread throughout the bar. I could not have stood out more if I tried—they were twice my size, with hair cropped and different shades of gold (some streaked with silver) and brown globes for eyes relative to mine. Their scrutiny made my skin crawl. _I should not have come here._

“Her? In those rags?”

“Surely…”

“But she’s the spittin’ image of Her on high!”

“You’d think She’d shy away from even a drop of liquor. But even I can’t deny there’s a resemblance…”

“It is… it is Her! I won’t believe otherwise!”

“They say it’ll be a massacre tomorrow, but if She’s here to… see us off?”

“That’s it! That must be it! She’s—she’s blessed us with her presence! She has returned!”

Gasps of realisation filled the room as confusion and fear turned to affirmation and excitement. Their faces warmed and smiles crept over their faces. But beneath the skin that wrapped over their skulls, I could sense festering, ravenous hunger. It was a face I knew well, no matter how many masks it may wear. They wanted something from me; something only I could provide. These men that had resigned themselves to their fate, with one foot in death’s door, were now faced with a sprig of hope. Their eyes had latched on to me and would stop at nothing for the salvation they presumed I could offer: that which I had no real power to.

One chair fell over with a crash, and its occupant leaped towards me. _Stay away!_ My eyes shut tight; but for some reason instinct did not raise my hands against him. I was terrified.

“Hear my plea, o Goddess!” His frail voice croaked not from his diaphragm but his throat, somewhere below me. I opened my eyes a crack and saw him on his knees, his forehead pressed against the floor and his palms in front of him. It was a gesture of utmost deference.

“I… I cannot die tomorrow… Please! I swore the oaths, took the pledges, but… even if this country stands tomorrow, who will take care of my sister? She can hardly walk, let alone feed herself. Please… I cannot desert, but I beg of you: with even a sliver of your power, please bless my sister… if you could keep watch over her, I will die tomorrow with my head held high. Please! I beg!”

I could not speak. _I can’t do that, you fool! I… I have no power! All this about eternal life… that is a curse even I don’t understand, not a power! _I could not escape the hundreds of eyes that bored into me. They would not permit an escape. After having shown my face, they would not simply allow me to walk out. _What would happen if I did? _I did not want to consider the thought.

And so I did as they wished. “I… cannot promise you anything. However, I will keep an eye on your scales, and those of your sister, and ensure that they are weighed justly. I can only pray that they may tip in your favour.” He burst into tears at my words, and wailed as only a dying man could. Before he could finish, a line had formed, and I was made to offer a similar blessing to each and every one of them. Grown men, trained for battle were reduced to whelping babies at my words, their hearts thawed by a chance at life.

I knew that I was peddling a lie, but I had no choice. _Besides, these men will likely die tomorrow. I don’t think they expect to be invulnerable. If I’m lucky, a few more will survive than expected, and the survivors will come home happy. Isn’t that what prayer is? A way to bolster your odds rather than a guarantee. Or at least, that’s how they see it. In truth, only they can weigh their scales with their own two hands. Their fates were sealed when they chose war._ I was still terrified, but as long as I prayed for them, they would not lay a finger on me.

“How are you doing?” The bartender flashed me a weak smile, having overcome his initial shock. Life had returned to his face once more. “I’ve had all sorts of patrons over the years, but you’re the first deity that’s walked through those doors.”

“I’m… nevermind. I’m tired. How long has it been?”

“An hour and a half? Maybe two. Give or take. You did a good thing.”

The impromptu ceremony had finally come to an end, and everyone had returned to their tables, fervently discussing the supposed euphoric effects they had experienced upon my words.

“The room brightened when she spoke.”

“I felt my body lighten, like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders.”

“My bones straightened out in an instant; my back doesn’t hurt no more!”

“My left eye can see again, all of a sudden. It’s a miracle!”

“I saw the gates of heaven behind her—white and pearly! She’s a true goddess!”

Their drinks sat untouched. Perhaps they felt a little embarrassed to ramble drunkardly in the presence of a so-called goddess, despite the fact that I too had taken a little sip.

“Sorry about the tiefdraught. Had I known, I wouldn’t have pushed one onto you.”

“No… it was, uh, delicious. Thank you.”

“Wahahaha! For a deity, you sure have a sense of humour. That was just a little prank—a rite of passage of sorts for those kids that like to swagger in and order a pint, acting tough as nails. You on the other hand—you’ve seen more than any of us could ever dream of imagining. Thank you for visiting—no, gracing us with your presence. I’ll be honest, all of this is still a bit too much for me… I’ve never really been the religious type, and I hope you won’t damn me for it. But I’m sure your power is true.”

“...”

“Ah… anyway, ya have a place to stay the night?”

“No… is there an inn nearby?”

“Yup, it’s above us. Part of the bar, actually. Of course, we’ve set one aside for you, if you’d please. Normally it’s a tad noisy, what with people puking in their sleep and such, but I suspect tonight might be quieter.”

“I’d like that very much. Thank you.”

I was too exhausted to think. My nerves had frayed, though I had calmed down a bit. A short while later, I was lying face-first on a silken pillow, my body wrapped in blankets against a soft featherbed. The room was dark and cosy. Slight murmurs and the clinking of someone washing dishes filtering in from beneath the door.

_What a lovely bed. I never thought sleep could seem so inviting. _

My body gave out, and I slept dreamlessly; the deepest I had ever slept since I first drew breath.

*

“Ah!” My eyes flew open and I gasped at the room lit up before me. It was made of polished timber and finely furnished, with a cupboard, a dressing table, and with shelves and framed artwork lining the walls. _What a beautiful room. So unlike my own. Wait, where am I?_

It took me a moment to recall the events of last night. Clearly it had been some time since then, with the sunlight streaming in through the blinds. A clock on the wall told me it was almost evening—I had slept for nearly a day. My stomach rumbled to confirm the fact.

_A whole day! That bartender did offer me this room for free, but I hardly want to seem like a freeloader! How embarrassing. I’d better leave as soon as I can. I think it might be best if I left this town for a while. Without a better disguise, I’m likely to draw attention wherever I go._

I stepped towards the door and fumbled with the lock (it was my second time using a human-made one), and just as I managed to unlatch it, a thunderous slam came from the other side. The recently-unlocked door flew open and into my forehead, knocking me off my feet.

“Goddess! You’ve got to hear—no, see this! You’ll never believe it! Huh—what are you doing on the floor? And say, shouldn’t you keep your door locked at night? Well, I suppose a goddess like you has other ways of keeping intruders out. Anyway, get up!”

The bartender stood in front of me occupying the entire doorframe. _Ow, ow, ow… you fool!_ My forehead throbbed, but it wasn’t bleeding. My butt had taken quite the impact, but the floor was a little creakier than I thought and had softened my landing a little. I lurched unsteadily to my feet. Before the world stopped spinning in front of me, the bartender grabbed my arm and rushed me out and down the stairs.

“Look! They’re all here—and not a single scratch on ‘em!”

“It’s her! The goddess! She of eternal life—her blessings held true!”

Raucous cheers and boisterous laughter filled the air. They were shouts that betrayed not just a victor’s pride but also hints of amusement and disbelief. A miracle must have happened. Something beyond imagination—something beyond the reach of mortal men.

Their faces slowly stopped spinning, and I realised the truth of what the bartender had exclaimed. They were all here. Not a single face was missing. Not only were they present—they were unharmed.

“What… what happened? Was the operation called off?”

“No! Well, perhaps yes, if you ask the enemy! Hahaha!” a soldier exclaimed.

“No, you fool, they were there too! Although you couldn’t call them much of an ‘enemy’!”

Laughter rang through the bar. I’m sure passers-by must have heard the clamour. However, I still did not understand what had happened, and was even more confused than before.

The bartender, with a smile of pity on his face, stepped towards me. “She’s a goddess! Show some respect and tell her what happened.”

“Respect? Please—I step out of the bathroom, hardly done zipping my pants  and the first thing I see is you slamming the door into her face! She of Eternal Life she may be, but I wouldn’t be surprised if you knocked a few years off her clock with that!”

They roared with laughter once more, clearly too drunk on victory (and ale) to care. They had changed completely from last night.

“Ah…” the bartender smiled sheepishly and leaned towards me. “Alright, well, here’s what happened. They were meant to assault a town we’d been sieging for a while last night. I say sieging, but it was more of just cutting off their supplies for a while. Anyway, they marched up to the walls—and it seems there’d been a plague! Nearly everyone there was half-dead, swaying about like drunkards, some barely able to sit upright. Even so, they sent a handful of stragglers out with swords, their eyes rolling in their sockets. Naturally, we slaughtered and burned them all. Can’t take any risks with the sick—don’t even want them as prisoners. Either way, it was a total victory—frontal assaults are usually the bloodiest, and you can’t imagine how glad these men were to come home alive—let alone unscathed!” 

“So… nobody died?”

“Right. Nobody died. And it’s all thanks to you.”

“Me?”

“Don’t tell me you don’t remember—that was just a wee sip of draught you had. The blessings! You said you’d pray for them, and you did. You watched over them. Thank you. Thank you. And thank you. None of us expected something like this. Perhaps Lady Luck was on our side, and with your grace, led us to a perfect outcome. Who knows. All I can say is that—”

The wizened man from yesterday flopped onto the floor before me, but this time with his face turned upright.

“Thank you! Oh… oh my… you have no idea… I’ll kiss the earth you walk on from now on… and I’d gladly die tomorrow if I had to… Thank you for letting me live just a day longer… Thank you… There’s really nothing I can do to repay you, but I swear! I’ll visit the chapel daily! I’ll drag my sister out of bed too with me if I have to! Everything I save after buying her medicine, I’ll donate as tithes! Oh…” His words soon devolved into shameless bawling, and he had to be carried away by his subordinates, smiling sheepishly on his behalf.

“Well, he said everything I wanted to say, and perhaps a bit more. So that’s that.”

“I… see.”

“I know what you’re thinking. Or, well, maybe I don’t—you’re a deity, after all. But I talked to them before you woke up. Don’t worry—they won’t be hounding you for blessings or prayers or anything like that. In fact, they should be going to the priestess at the chapel for this stuff, but to be frank, a lot of them weren’t the god-fearing type till last night, and would have rather spent their coin on whores than tithes.

“But after the miracle you wrought last night, things have changed. We’ve blasphemed, but we’re changing. We’ve changed. And we’ll never lose sight of you and your generosity. We won’t be bothering you anymore, but…”

“...?”

“Perhaps… you could stay with us a little longer? This inn isn’t a place befitting your stature—the chapel would be honoured to have you. Your mere presence in this town is working wonders. The news has already spread, and the town seems happier for it. Full of hope—I can see it in their eyes. Imagine how they’d feel to know that you—the goddess herself—is present in the flesh at the very chapel they pray at! I know how insolent it is to demand this of you, but—please stay with us!”

_The chapel._ I had walked past it at some point; it was a cathedral of sorts, ornate and extravagant in its architecture. From a brief peek through its windows its furnishings and interior had seemed almost palatial. The clergy must live a lavish life here. _Me, a cave dweller sleeping first on rock, then a mat in my cottage, then a featherbed in an inn, and now a chapel fit for royalty? What a joke._

I was undeserving. What had I done? Nothing. All I offered were empty words and promises. The plague was pure coincidence. I had nothing to do with it. The effect was there, but the cause lay elsewhere. Bad luck, perhaps. Or poor outbreak control. Either way, there was no reason why I should be offered a home for free in exchange. _What if the plague hadn’t happened? _They’d have been massacred. What then? What would they have thought of the supposed goddess that led them all to their deaths? Surely it would not have been a chapel in store for me. I shivered at the thought.

That being said, my heart was one that had been ripped to shreds and ground to dust by time. I could not find room in it for guilt or conscience. Forgive me, a supposed “goddess” for such material thoughts, but the night I spent in that featherbed nearly brought me to tears. It offered comfort and security I never experienced in the eternity I had spent in this immortal yet corporeal vessel. I could not pass up the opportunity for more luxury. Had I not struggled enough? All this time I never considered reward or compensation for my suffering, but here it was being offered to me on a platter just for a few kind words. _Is this okay?_

“...Okay. I accept. Please guide me to the chapel.”

*

It was through this bizarre stroke of luck that I began a new chapter of my life at the chapel. It was manned by a priestess pure of heart and closer to divinity than even I could hope to be, as well as a congregation of devoted nuns. They were all women—apparently a gender that held some sort of hallowed status here, perhaps because of my own. My role was that of a figurehead. I was not called upon often, but my presence at events and ceremonies brought great joy to the people. The mere fact that I resided within these walls inspired them to behave in a manner befit residents of a nation selected by God. The unparalleled confidence that came with divine recognition drove them to reach beyond their means and strive, which led to economic prosperity, peace in the streets and greater military success. Of course, future battles did not go as smoothly as that legendary town assault I apparently had a hand in, but the people were reasonable. Empowered by their renewed faith, they fought harder and more bravely in battle, leading to victories they attributed to my watching over them. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy that I had nothing to do with, but simply benefited one. I felt gluttonous. 

I did not, however, live like some sort of spoiled queen. After much pleading I convinced the nuns to let me assist in their work. I handled decidedly unholy chores such as cleaning and cooking; but I enjoyed it. It was all I knew (aside from hunting, which was not something I was permitted to do). I felt a semblance of control over my life return to my grasp as I performed these chores, even if it was a mere facade: I was still living a far more coddled life than anyone else in this city.

However, I did have another motive, and it was for that reason I was here with a quill in my hand, sitting next to the head priestess, scribbling her every word onto bound parchment.

“The aforementioned reagent, when poured into the catalyst, results in bubbling for a short duration that intensifies with the volume of silverbright used. This is normal, but may spew, so ensure that the cauldron is covered to prevent spillage. Once the concoction has—are you tired, Dear?”

“What? No, of course not.”

“But concoction has three c’s in it.”

“Three? But—oh no, you’re right. Ugh.”

She giggled. The way she addressed me was strange, but it was a lot more comfortable to me than being called “Her Divinity” at first. I had begged her to use my name, but she could not see that as anything other than disrespectful. Eventually, after trying several pronouns, Dear was the best she could do. It was awkward, but I grew to like it. That was not all—I had grown fond of her in whole, and her giggle set my heart aflutter just as it did the first time I heard it. While the other nuns were quite devoted in their worship of me (and the religion they had invented around me), they did sometimes behave as though they were here simply to work. That did not make their work any less admirable; it was a perfectly reasonable, human attitude to have, but it made the head priestess shine greater in comparison. She was kind and devoted to the people. She offered aid and food to the needy and waived charges for the poor. She conducted every mass with diligence and grace, thinking only of enriching the lives of those that attended. She talked to me often to check in on me and listen to my requests, and always found the time to listen when I sought her company. I even told her the tale I am telling you now—the story of my life—and she listened attentively to every word. That night, I sobbed into her warm embrace like a toddler. There were no words of comfort she could offer, and we both understood that—the pain I had endured was on a scale too great for any human to imagine. All I needed was her trust, and she lay it bare for me to indulge in.

Only she was privy to my secrets, for they would cause trouble if anyone were to find out. After all, the myths spoke of a goddess atop a winged beast—and I had never ridden one, although I was birthed from one. Those discrepancies confused me as well as the head priestess, but such secrets only served to tighten our bonds. She told me a bit about her past, but her childhood had been in a warm, joyful home; one that she felt almost embarrassed to tell me about after hearing about mine. That didn’t matter to me; I wanted to hear it, for it was _her_ past. I felt no envy or anger. I wanted to share in the joy preserved in her memories; I wanted a sliver of the warmth of her family that showed in the mundane acts of love they did for each other. She took them for granted, but I hung onto every word. Thus did the boundaries of our lives slowly begin to overlap. 

“We’ll have to redo this page. Good thing you only wrote half of it.”

“Right… Yeah. Sorry.”

“Don’t be. It’s rare to see you make a mistake. Perhaps you’re more human than I thought.” She giggled again. Her round, amber eyes held no hint of anger or malice. They betrayed a hint of mischief missing from her calm, almost motherly tone of voice. I stared into them for a moment, admiring their symmetry in her small, round face that was framed with long, golden hair. 

“Something on my face?”

_You’re stunningly beautiful. _“Ah… no.”

“Then let’s resume. Dear.” She smiled.

“Of course.” _Perhaps I should make mistakes more often. I’m quite fond of the way she smiles when I do._

_*_

The crimson brush withered as winter rolled in, blanketing the town in dirty snow. It piled on the streets and turned to grey slush, bringing the city to a halt. Military operations had come to a standstill; even taking the weather into account, the tides of fortune had begun to turn against us. Casualties spiked beyond the bar of what was deemed acceptable—a bar that had been shifted dramatically as a result of my presence. Morale began to droop, and economic depression loomed on the horizon. It was a dreary winter for sure, and people were beginning to wonder if there was hope to be found in the summer.

Religion is a funny thing. It feeds into itself. Attendance had been at an all-time high during recent times of prosperity, but now it seemed that most preferred to stay at home, perhaps showing their devotion in private (or not at all). The coffers were running dry. We had always been funded in part by the monarch’s administration, but it became harder to justify our share of taxpayer money given the economic downturn and the town’s bad fortune. 

“Yes, Dear?”

I stood in the doorway to her room. She stood with her back towards me as she took off her hood, still dressed in the rest of her habit. She had just finished conducting mass for three attendees.

“Will we be okay?”

“What’s wrong?”

“Well… nobody’s coming to mass anymore. Our tithes are drying up.”

“Don’t worry. We can last a bit longer. Till harvest season, perhaps. Not that there’ll be much to reap.”

“What about after?”

She turned towards me with a blank stare on her face.

“After?”

“I know this is rude, but we can’t realistically survive if we’re constantly burning money.”

“Well… we’ll have more tithes coming in, won’t we?” Her question seemed disguised as a command. For once, I felt a tinge of apprehension at her words. _It’s fine. She’s just a little tired; maybe disappointed at today’s turnout._

“Um… I don’t know.”

“You should, though. You’re God. You’d know better than I do: the fate that lies in store for us all. The divine chronology. Right?”

“...”

“I can’t say the lack of tithes is purely because nobody wants to trudge through the snow, although that certainly is a factor. There’s… something else. A shadow, perhaps, cloaking the town, smothering it. I don’t know what it is. Things haven’t been going well for us lately.”

“...A shadow? No, I think… perhaps it’s just a spell of bad luck.”

Her eyes narrowed, lit ablaze by the lone oil lamp that kept the room from being cloaked in darkness. “So what about everything until now? Was that merely a spell of good luck?”

I couldn’t answer. The truth was that I had no idea. What was the cause for our good fortune till now? The plagued town. The military victories. The economic upturn. They had been relentless, but diminishing. I wanted to believe that I had had a hand in our good fortune. I wanted to believe that my divine presence had guided this town down the right path. But I had no power. That didn’t contradict how I felt; I had already acknowledged the self-fulfilling prophecy of religion. Those that believe in it act with greater faith, and the fruits of that faith strengthen their beliefs. But was my only role that of a catalyst to kick-start this chain reaction of events? What meaning was there in titles and worship if I had no real influence over the world?

It then struck me that this wish of mine was the ultimate sin. My first act of divinity was to strike down an entire town with a plague. My worshipers then saw it fit to slaughter and burn them to ash. In wishing for power over fortune, I was seeking credit for this massacre. And yet, without that power and the infamy that came with it, what was I doing here, living like royalty?

The only path free of sin was to acknowledge reality; that this had all been the result of a single lucky coincidence. That placebo had driven us forward since then, and that its effects were beginning to wane. After all, we tend to remember strokes of misfortune over those of fortune; I could grace the people with ten blessings a day, but eventually they would be taken for granted. The occasional instances of bad luck would fester in their minds, begging the question of why an all-powerful deity could not prevent such trivial calamities. And such thoughts would erode their faith, defeating any influence I might have.

“Do you know what they say?”

“At mass?”

“Yes. They complain. They say things like: my crops withered. Someone in my family caught the flu and died. My friend disappeared after taking out a loan in my name and now I have to pay it off. Everyday tragedies, but perhaps you’re unfamiliar with them. They always lead up to the same thing: why is it that a deity that can plague an entire town can’t cure a simple flu for a single man? Or cure crops of disease? Why is a deity that can bring good fortune to the town’s economy as a whole unable to pay off a single man’s debt?”

She spoke clearly the fears that had taken root in my mind. Divine miracles are arbitrary, yet people always expect them to apply to them. They see miracles as an application of power rather than events of chance borne from a greater power. It is a very human way of seeing things: divine power being a scale with “striking down a town with a plague” at the extreme end, and everything in between being easily possible with a snap of one’s fingers. Like magic.

What terrified me the most was the look of inquisition she had in her eyes. It was not one I had ever witnessed before, and it pierced into me, nailing my conscience to the wall. I could not bear it any longer and was just about to look away when a gust of wind snuffed the lamp out.

“Ah! It’s pitch dark. Oh no. I can barely see my nose.” Her disorientation showed in her tone.

I rushed towards her and held her hands. I could barely make out her face in front of mine.

“Sorry! I didn’t mean to interrogate you. I’m just… ah, I’m so exhausted, hearing these complaints all the time. I feel so pathetic—useless, even. All I can do is lend an ear. All this talk of death and debt… it’s too much for me to bear.” Her expression softened and turned into a faint smile that I chose to trust. There was nothing else in the darkness for me to cling on to.

“It’s okay. Let’s do our best together from now on. Please let me help in any way I can.”

“Thank you… I’m sorry, but I might have to take you up on that offer.”

*

Time drained our coffers as our fortunes worsened. The current state of the town was not unprecedented, but for it to decline immediately after our divine spell of good fortune made it seem far worse. Murmurs of sin and deserved punishment filled the town; the citizens could not accept that their lives lay at the whims of fate’s spinning dice. Someone had done something, and the gods were displeased. But who, and what? Nobody could say.

The military had burned through much of our food and gold reserves a year ago in several drawn-out battles simultaneously, high on the divine favour they presumed had warded them. These battles had not gone smoothly as they hoped. Either they underestimated the enemy, or overestimated themselves—and nobody wanted to consider the enemy stronger than God’s will. This year’s harvest could not compensate, and food had to be rationed. We were not starving yet, but the possibility loomed over our heads like an omen. Medicine and wards had to be reserved for the maimed military, plunging the rest of the populace into poor health, compounded by our lean diets. The head priestess’ shoulders weighed heavy with the confessions and lamentations she heard on a daily basis from the commoners, shocked at the despair they were made to face. She eventually gave in to my pleas and allowed me to man the confessional on occasion—a decision that I came to regret.

“They say you descended upon a winged steed bearing gifts. Where the hell are they? Surely you could afford to hand out a few bowls of soup. All I have to eat are crumbs after my son has had his share—which, mind you, is hardly enough to feed a toddler! And we’ve got another baby on the way!”

“It’s absurd that there isn’t a drop of sphia in this town. Not one! Do the soldiers like the taste of it too much to spare some for the rest of us peasants? My father can hardly get out of bed, and none of us can get any sleep with his wailing through the night. I’m sure the church has some—hell, I’m sure you could brew a vial if you were so inclined.”

“My crops are dead, and I can’t afford to wait till the next harvest. I can barely afford to plant another crop. Why? I told him… I told my husband that new house was a bad idea! Seems like the moment we bought it, everything’s gone to the dogs. Say, maybe you hate that hideous coat of yellow he painted it over with? I’ll do anything to paint it to your liking. What would you prefer?”

It was agony. Attendance doubled as the town lined up to vent their anger at me. While nobody went so far as to _accuse_ me of cursing the town, they expected me to do something about the situation. All I could do was acknowledge their troubles, but I did not have the courage to make promises. My empty platitudes disappointed everyone that showed up. I was heartbroken. I was angry too; not at them, but myself for being so powerless. My respect for the head priestess only grew knowing the cuts her heart had had to endure doing this alone.

“Before I showed up, who handled the confessional?” I flopped onto a chair, exhausted from the day’s work. 

“Me. I rarely let anyone else do it.”

“I don’t understand how you did this for years.”

“Well, people weren’t as angry then. But there were times like this too.”

“Hm… well, that doesn’t really answer my question.”

She giggled sheepishly. “I don’t have a good answer. When it became too much to bear, I cried into my pillow. That was all I could do.”

“What about the other nuns? Couldn’t you have vented to them a little?”

“The other nuns”—her voice softened, her face forlorn—”never wanted much to do with me.”

“Why’s that?”

“We get along fine, but… I’ve known most of them since we were kids, but there was never time for anything beyond small talk. I spent my childhood helping at the chapel when I wasn’t studying at the convent. Naturally, The circles they formed excluded me. I never gave myself a chance to be a part of them. And why should I have? I was training to be a nun; a servant of God. Helping the needy fulfilled me far more than talking to children my age did. Looking back, that was horribly pretentious of me.”

“I don’t think it’s pretentious to help people.”

“No, that’s not it—my intentions were not as pure as you assume. Maybe it filled me with a sense of superiority, or perhaps it was an excuse to justify my stunted social skills. I don’t know. Either way, there was no room in my heart for anyone other than strangers seeking aid.”

“I see… It never once seemed to me that you and the nuns were on bad terms.”

“Bad terms? I wouldn’t say that… They didn’t hate me. I still talked to them on occasion, and we shared meals together. But I could always sense the distance between us that we mutually upheld. It wasn’t hate, but… they saw me as an outsider, one that could never understand their whims and troubles.”

“Yet they let you man the confessional! That’s funny.”

She giggled. “You might be right. Then again, it is my _duty._ You know, one of them did once tell me that I was the perfect nun, and that she wanted to be like me. We never spoke after that conversation. I was not a friend to confide in—I was simply an ideal for her to strive towards, even if I did not feel I met that standard.”

“...That might be putting you on too high a pedestal.” _I’m one to talk._

“I don’t know… Standing atop this pedestal—that was and will always be my role; one I have no choice but to play. In hindsight, my childhood was a terrible mistake. It let me down a path I can not stray from on a whim. However, I have no regrets. I have saved lives, and will continue to save lives. That is the least I can do to repay those that raised me.”

She was my only refuge. Our bonds deepened as I took on more of her work. She understood and empathised with my pain completely, having experienced the same. We became inseparable, sharing meals and even baths together, too exhausted after a long day’s work to wait in turn. I became obsessed with confiding in her, as though my thoughts were meaningless unless she heard them. She reciprocated, telling me her hesitations over the future, and stories of her past. Soon we came to know almost everything there was to know about each other—a bond I had never once experienced in my countless years of life. It intoxicated me. The angel painted in the stained glass window had always seemed mute, as though it were me preserved in death—but when by her side, it turned vivid—full of life, like the wells of amber in her eyes. I longed to be perceived in them now and forever—they gave me cause to exist. I dreamt every night about the floors I swept and the meals I cooked with her, looking eagerly forward to the chores of tomorrow. I gluttonously indulged in her beauty and kindness without restraint. Soon, she became all I could think about.

“Quite the line today,” I observed with apathy as I concentrated on brushing her smooth, golden hair. Listening to the commoners was no less depressing than before, but it had become routine.

Her eyes, reflected in the dingy dressing table mirror she sat before, stretched open and flicked up to meet mine. Not a common occurrence, being a head shorter than her, but one I treasured. Why? Well, I found it cute.

“Perhaps you should let me listen to them. The sight of you… agitates them sometimes.”

“No. No. I’ll do it. Don’t you worry.” I continued brushing her hair gently as a mother would.

“Why? I appreciate you doing this, but…”

“I’ve seen the toll this takes on you. Is it so wrong to let me shoulder that burden?”

“Yes, but… I’m a priestess, you know? I was trained to do this. And we can’t have you at the confessional forever. If the people would rather lament to me, it is only right that we let them.”

“The people? But—” My words hung in the air. Something had changed. I stepped towards the window, and sensed a murmuring.

“What’s wrong?”

I opened the window a crack and the issue became clear. _The noise!_ A massive crowd had gathered two storeys below us, yelling on the streets. Both displeasure and confusion showed in their voices; this couldn’t be an organised protest. They had simply gathered and realised they could complain to each other rather than wait their turn for a chance to vent at the deity; neither approach helped, so why wait?

“Um… they seem a little unhappy.”

“Oh no. No, no, no… No, see, this is what I meant. I should have faced them instead of you. How, how”—her voice began to quiver—”long has it been since I last swapped with you? I’ve been so busy with the inventory and coffers lately that…”

“Relax. Stop worrying. This really isn’t healthy for you—”

The sound of glass breaking shattered the warmth that enveloped us both in our room at the top of this place of worship. I looked down—someone in the crowd had taken the initiative to throw a rock into the chapel. For a moment, the street fell silent—but just for a moment. Chaos ensued immediately after. Rocks rained against the walls of the chapel, shattering the windows and chipping away at the walls.

“No! What—what’s going on!” The priestess rushed to her feet and towards the window. The shock at having our sanctity violated so brazenly in broad daylight had stunned me into silence. The frenzied mob climbed in through the broken windows and rushed into the chapel. Moments later, they returned, their arms full of stolen silverware.

The people were looting the chapel. Perhaps there were a few among them poor enough that they had no other resort. The majority of them were not, but emboldened by the crowd regardless to follow suit. They streamed in like rats and plundered without pause.

_“No! Stop! Stay away!” _Heads turned below towards the head priestess’ voice: one they had not heard for a while. 

“It’s her—and the deity! Up there, in that window—look!”

“What? What are they doing up there? Shouldn’t they be opening the chapel? Look at how many of us are here already—would it hurt to open the doors a little earlier?”

“What do you mean? She’s half-dressed! Where’s her habit? Her hood? I’ve never even once caught a glimpse of her hair before, and here she is, yelling at us looking like she just woke up!”

“Isn’t that the deity next to her? With—what, a _brush_ in her hand?”

“What the hell? Bloody nuns have all the time in the world to look prim in the morning, do they?”

“And to think they’re living off _our money! _I can barely afford to put food on the table—what a sight!”

“Hey! You fools! Stop looting the place and find them! Drag the nuns out here, every one of them—they’ve mocked our faith long enough! And that deity too!”

“Everything’s gone to shit after she showed up. Everything! And to think she gets to live here for free, like royalty!”

“Who’s the one that let her? The head priestess, that’s who! Find her!”

I slammed the window shut and drew the curtains. Blood drained out of my body, and the room began to spin.

_What… what the hell? What’s happening?_

Her voice cut through the fog. “No…! They’re in the chapel… What do we do? What am I supposed to do?!”

“We…” My mind drew a blank. I did not want to face the crowd. 

The floor shook as the crowd thundered up the stairs, throwing doors open and ransacking rooms on their way up. They would rip us apart and to shreds, bringing an end to the peace we shared.

_All I wanted was a home and someone to love. It took me all of eternity to find what I sought. Homes can be reconstructed, but people cannot. If I let her slip through my hands now, how long will it take for me to find her again? There might never be a second chance… for she is not cursed as I am._

“Hide! We have to hide—quickly!” She grabbed my hand and pulled me into the closet, snapping me back to reality. I shut the door behind me, plunging us into a womblike darkness. The thick, mahogany doors muffled the frenzy of the mob, granting us a moment’s relief. We both knew it would not last; but what were we to do? We were animals trapped in a cage. There was no way out—except through the window, to our deaths.

“It’s… really warm, and hard to breathe… Could you move a little?”

“There’s no space. If I move, the doors will creak open.”

“Ah… well, to be honest, we’re likely to be found anyway, with how they’re turning our rooms inside out… maybe we should have chosen a better hiding spot. Or the window…”

“No. Absolutely not. I will not watch as you throw your life away for no reason.”

“You don’t have to. We could go together, hand in hand.”

“I would never dream of using my hands to escort you to your death, even if it meant my own.”

“So stubborn. I think it’d be a beautiful show of defiance.”

“Defiance?”

“That the head priestess with her heart in the clouds, yearning only to serve the people, could find a friend to die with.”

“That’s not a very nun-like thing to say.”

Her smile did not reach her eyes still filled with terror, but it was a smile nonetheless. It disappeared in an instant as the mob thumped their fists against the door to our room.

“Hey! This one’s locked!”

She wrapped her arms around me how only someone staring death in the face could. I reciprocated, knowing that this might be my last chance to feel her warmth. Her heart thumped against mine. Her body, drenched in sweat, heaved as though every ragged breath she drew seared her lungs.

“Are you okay?”

“No… I’m scared.”

_You’re not the only one,_ I held myself back from saying. The sight of her on the verge of panic was enough to push me over the edge too. There was so much left unsaid between us. So many days left unspent together. _I am not asking for the world. All I want is a slice of it; this chapel, for us to call home. This chapel, where we can spend the rest of our days together in service of the people. I want to walk your path with your hand in mine and show you that it is one you do not have to pursue alone. Is that too much to ask?_

The door splintered open with a crash.

“It’s empty. What? Did they jump out?”

“No, you fool, they’re obviously hiding.”

“There might be a secret passage. Search the other rooms! We’ll search this one.”

Tears streamed out of her eyes wide as saucers as she began to hyperventilate.

“Calm… calm down… I need you to calm down. Or they’ll hear us.”

“Where… where are you? I can’t see you… it’s too dark…”

“I’m here. I’m right here. Look, I’m holding you as tight as I can.”

“I can’t… I can’t feel anything… you’re there, aren’t you?”

“I’m here. Can you hear me? I’m here, and I always will be. I will never leave your side.”

“...”

_I’m here! I’m here, can’t you see? There’s no way they can’t hear her through the doors. I have to… I have to do something_—

So I did the only thing I could think of. I stood on my toes and silenced her by kissing her. I tightened my grip around her body with one hand and slid the other behind her head, cushioning it against the closet. I pushed against her, hoping my weight would comfort her like a heavy blanket. _I should have done this earlier._ I could only hope that my love would still her beating heart and bring her back to her senses.

I felt her heart beat once—twice—before the doors flew open and light spilled into the closet, baring us to the world. For a moment, all fell still. I couldn’t see who was behind me, but they did not touch me. They did not say a word. They could only watch in astonishment as we stood with our lips locked, the world out of sight.

It was the woman I loved the most that broke the silence. She could see the mob in full view, and sense returned to her eyes. They narrowed in shock and confusion; she then shoved me away with all her strength. Standing on my toes offered me no way to recover and I tumbled backwards, landing sprawled on my back.

“What… why would you do that? To me?” She wiped her lips with her sleeve as though they were covered in grime.

“...”

Finally, the mob spoke. “The nun… and the deity… what the hell’s going on?” Their faces contorted with shock and disgust.

“No… I didn’t… She pulled me into the closet and trapped me there, against the wall!” Her eyes were wide open, burning with fury, tears streaming out of them.

“The deity? She did?”

“Deity…? She’s no deity at all… All she’s done is bring misfortune on us all! No, that’s not right… She’s just a regular girl, with no power to speak of! She’s delusional—says she’s lived for countless years—but she’s as human as the rest of us! You’ve been spouting drivel about how she’s blessed us with her power, about how she’s warding us from death—but she hasn’t done anything! I’ve seen it with my own two eyes: all she does is man the confessional, but she can’t do a damn thing about what plagues us!”

_What are you saying? Why would you say those things about me? Why would you tell them?_ 

She still heaved and sobbed as she spoke, as nervous as she was in the closet, but her heart bled, drenching every word she spoke in the anger that had taken over her. She was furious.

“There isn’t a drop of divinity in your blood… and yet, the town credits you for all the good that’s happened. But you didn’t do any of it—and what’s more, you’re a blasphemer! Who gets the credit doesn’t matter to me a bit, as long as it helps the people, but… I cannot forgive a sinner. Someone who seeks to stray me from the path God has laid out for me—someone who disguises themselves as Her in front of the city! Have you no shame?”

_Stop. Stop. I’m sorry. I didn’t know. I messed up. I’m sorry. Please, stop. Please. _Every word she spoke stabbed my heart as though nailing it to a cross.

“Runaways like you show up at the chapel every now and then. Often with grand stories to tell, or none at all—but yours was the grandest of them all. I always lent them a hand; helped them get back on their feet, then sent them on their ways, but you stayed. And I liked you. It didn’t matter that you were dishonest—everyone has their secrets. I could respect that. And I thought I could trust you, but I never thought you would look at me with such lust—especially since you’re a _woman!_

“And… I’ve tried to look the other way this whole time, hoping you’d get a hint, but… I am a _nun!_ I am sworn to celibacy! I cannot believe you would have the… _audacity_ to blaspheme the way you just did, by staining my lips with yours. I considered you a true friend—the _only_ friend I have ever had—but I have _never, ever_ seen you as anything more—and it _disgusts_ me the way I see myself reflected in your eyes. I was willing to look past your faults, every single one of them, for we were _friends_, but… to soil me like this is not something even She on high can overlook.”

_No more. Please. I want to die. Please, just kill me. End me now. If this is a dream—no, a nightmare, please let me wake up._

Having said her piece, she dropped to her knees and began to sob. The mob began to stir, their target clear.

“She’s… not a deity?”

“Of course not—she was sent here to… corrupt the priestess! And to bring ruin to the city!”

“She’s no deity, she’s a _witch! _A_ curse!”_

“A curse upon the land! Take her away!”

The bloodthirsty mob surrounded me. Tall, ragged men towered over me, overlapping me in shadow, their breathing haggard and their sweat dripping onto me. _Stay away. Stay away!_ They looked at me with eyes cold and narrow and devoid of mercy.

I knew immediately that—_there was no reasoning with such men, and that to fight back would get me killed. _It was a deep, primal response instilled within me, and I knew better than to argue with instinct. So I sobbed, for there was nothing else I could do.

I had barely begun when one of them swung their fist into the back of my head, slamming it into the floor. My vision blinked out and as the last of my consciousness faded away, I felt a sliver of gratitude. _It would be a mercy to die here at the feet of someone as holy and righteous as you. I can only hope that you might look upon my corpse as I am dragged away and sear it into your mind. Would you do that—for a sinner like me?_

*

I awoke in squalor. Dank, mouldy walls wrapped tight around me, offering just enough space to stand or lie down. Through the bars in front of me I could see a dark corridor, lit slightly by faint torchlight. I was too exhausted to try shaking the bars. My stomach was hollow, and my throat dry like sand.

I lay there until the torch died out. Someone re-lit it, then walked over to my cell.

“You… is that you..?” My throat, frozen by the winter chill, croaked barely loud enough for him to hear.

He turned towards me, his colossal body eclipsing the torchlight. There was nothing written on his face. No sympathy nor mockery. No shock, nor revulsion. His laugh, full of unassuming joy and soul, would never rattle my eardrums again.

“I didn’t think you’d end up here, in the bowels of the earth. This isn’t the place for someone like you.” He kneeled and slid a tray of food through a flap in the bars. I pounced on it like an animal and scarfed it down, desperate for sustenance as he looked down at me wordlessly.

“I’m just here because the inn’s nearby, so they told me to bring you something every now and then. Don’t want you starving to death in here. Besides, I’m the one who got you to lodge up at the chapel, so they figure it’s best I feed you. Nobody else wants to get close.

“There’s not much I can do for ya. Business has been bad lately, what with people calling us the ‘Witch’s Inn’ and what not. I’m sorry. I put ya up to this, and look at where it’s gotten you. If there’s anything in particular you’d like, I can bring it over. I’d rather it go to use than rot in the cellar.”

I found the strength to look up at his silhouette. “What’s next? What’s going to happen to me?”

“You’ll… be burned at the stake, perhaps. The city’s out for blood, and they’re rejoicing now that you’re here. I’m the last person that should be saying this, but if I were you, I’d stop eating. Rather die of starvation than fire.”

“...”

“Well… I imagine you’re not in the mood to talk. God… this is so condescending, but it breaks my heart to see you in there. I’ll be off, then.”

Light filtered into the cell once more, and his footsteps trailed off into silence. _This is it. The end. Maybe they’ll let me live a few more days before killing me. What day is it today? I don’t remember. Executions were… every Friday, I think? I never saw one… not like they’d hold them near the chapel. _

_I caused her so much trouble. I had no idea she felt that way. All I had were assumptions built on top of one another, leading me to see her differently from she saw me. She was just too nice to tell me otherwise; but how can I blame her? It was that very kindness that I fell in love with. I should have known from the beginning: she had no room in her heart for me. Didn’t she say something like that once? I was too blind to realise it then. How fitting that I can hardly see in this cell._

_I get it now. Rather, I’ve known for a while, but it’s time for me to accept it_—_I am abnormal. From the moment I first drew breath, there was never a place in this world for me. I knew it then, but I had never so strongly wished to be wrong before. Was that what drove me to come here? I could have stayed in my cottage forever, but could you truly consider that a “place” in this world? A place like that, something carved out by my own hands, to be occupied by nobody else… can’t be called a home. A home… is something you share. That was why I loved you so_—_I yearned to be present in your eyes, and thought you wished the same of me. That mutual desire in a place we called home was what I sought. That home never existed, right from the beginning. It was fiction; fantasy, a tale I spun in desperation._

_Let it end here. It’s simple. All I have to do is starve and die, like he said. I don’t need to lift my hands anymore, or even open my eyes. I just have to lie here like a corpse; to play the role of one, until I turn into one myself. A natural process._

It was then that I remembered my curse. _Eternal life… but surely that doesn’t make me invincible? I have always felt the fear of death just like any mortal; all that separates me from the others is that death never comes for me. Were I to be decapitated or drowned, surely that would snuff the life out of me. If it did not, that would be a truly abominable curse._

I did not heed his suggestion. I ate the next meal he brought me, and the next. He shook his head in pity every time. It was not my fear of the nature of my curse that drove me to eat; after all, I would be burned alive either way. Eating did nothing to save me from that fate. No, it was a more primal, basal instinct: the urge to live. A simple, unassailable force of nature, as pure as a motive could be. I saw food, and my body ate. I could think of nothing more than the rumbling of my stomach. 

Weeks passed, but in truth, it must have been days. Time passes differently in a cell, out of sight and out of mind. A frailer set of footsteps echoed down the hallway, signalling the end of my stay.

“H-hello… please, wake up.”

I rolled over and stared at him. Our perspectives had swapped, but I recognised him immediately.

“Hello… how is your sister doing?”

He sunk his face into his palms and sobbed. _Perhaps I shouldn’t have asked._ “Ah… I’m shocked you remember.” He peered through his fingers at me.

I forced a reassuring smile. “The love you held for her was clear as day. I could never forget your joy the day after.”

“She’s, well, she’s dead. Watching over us, I hope.”

“Oh. I’m sorry.”

“No, don’t be. She lived so much longer than anyone thought she would. We spent that time bringing her around, as far as her body would permit, to see all she hadn’t had a chance to. She only died because of the rationing, and as one of the soldiers lying in bed guzzling sphia, I had no right to complain.

“I know what the town says about you. But believe me when I say this”—the torchlight glinted in his eyes—”the magic you wrought that day was true. What happened afterwards doesn’t disprove that. I should have died that day, but you caused a miracle. Not magic—a miracle. And that’s a fact. If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t be standing here today.

“Ever since then, I’ve resolved to stand on my own feet. Perhaps that was why I could never bring myself to go to the chapel. The idea of pushing my troubles, my pains and burdens and complaints onto someone else never sat well with me. That didn’t change the fact that I was—and still am—in your debt. You saved me, but I never thanked you properly for it.”

“...No, you did… the next day, didn’t you? It’s okay… you’ve thanked me enough.”

“Anyone can flap their tongues a little in your name. No. I will repay my debt in full. I’m sure you know, but I’ve been sent here to take you to the stake.” He held a large sack in his hands. “They don’t trust witches with chains and shackles. No, it’s gotta be a sack. Ridiculous, isn’t it?”

“So, are you going to put me in that?”

“Heavens no. There’s only room for one.”

“What… surely you aren’t proposing burning someone else in my stead? I’d rather die!”

“No, she’s already dead. Of natural causes, mind you. Just had to do a little digging. Don’t worry, I didn’t touch any graves I didn’t have the right to.”

“...”

“What happens at the stake—that’s anybody’s guess, but they’d have to be blind not to tell the difference. Maybe they’ll believe it was witchcraft. I’ll deal with it somehow.” He fiddled with his keys and unlocked the gate. “Take the stairs to the right. Don’t worry, I know this place well. Cripples like me can’t find work anywhere else. Go two floors down, then lift the grate. Crawl till you hear water, then feel for the fork going left. Go down it till you see light. After that, you’re on your own.”

My feet were too numb from disuse to move, so he lifted me by the arms and held me till I could stand upright. I was in disbelief. I was already resigned to death, so to be lifted out of my grave and made to walk was a shock. I did not—could not—perceive mercy in what he was doing. It dawned on me that this was perhaps the only time the world had offered me salvation—a tug away from the brink of death. The world never conspired to help me out of any genuine desire to see me happy. That the world could even conceive of such a plan was suspect. No, this was something more like homeostasis. People are symbiotic—they live on the backs of others, and strive to climb over those above them. To live alone is to divoce oneself from this hierarchy completely and to _them_ is no better than lying dead in the ground. And so they pull me back into the grinder with sprigs of hope that only serve to guide me deeper into the depths of despair, prostrating at their feet. The only place I was genuinely happy in—the chapel—had been a castle of mirrors onto which I projected my own ugly self. The happiness I sought there was fundamentally incompatible with its habitants who scurried behind the mirrors, assuming I could see through them, leaving me to flounder in the delusion I was not alone.

“No… I’m sorry. I won’t leave.”

“Huh… The hell are you saying? You’re to be burned alive on the morrow!”

“Perhaps that is what I deserve. I will not put you at risk for a chance at life—something I do not deserve to reach for.”

“Rubbish. You’re lucky to be alive, you realise that?”

“I never once asked for—”

“No!” He heaved, his once gentle eyes now lit with fury as though a pendulum had swung within him. “You don’t realise… perhaps because you’re divinity, though you look a right mortal in my eyes, starving like a rat; but death is not something you welcome with both arms. It’s ugly and despicable and pure agony till the very end. I’ve lost count of how many soldiers I’ve seen turn to corpses in my arms, some with their bodies in parts.”

_I don’t care. I didn’t ask to hear your story. Why are you telling me this? What does this have to do with me? I won’t weep for you. My tears dried a long time ago. To begin with, you aren’t here out of compassion for me. _

“My sister didn’t have an easy time of it either. Watching her vomit the soup I fed her is something I’d never like to see again. I could see the pain she was in plastered across her face till her last breath. I don’t understand. Is it necessary for one man to witness so much death? The prospect of my own terrifies me so; why must I be reminded of it through the people around me? Hey… do you know?”

_In your eyes, you’re a saviour. And that’s all that matters to you._

“I suppose even an angel has questions they can’t answer. Either way, I won’t let yet another life slip through my fingers.”

_And why does that have to be mine?_

“You can stand, right? Go. Leave. Trust me. Clear your mind and run and don’t look back.”

_Why? Answer me._

“This is… the least I can do for you in return. A final act of penance from my sister and I. _Go!_”

He shoved me. I stumbled forward and broke into the frenzied run of an animal learning to walk on two legs. _Debt. That’s all that brought you here. You’ve repaid your debt, and now your mind is clear. _I nearly tumbled down the stairs. _Was I ever anything else in your eyes? _I pounced on the grate sticky with grease and wrenched it out with what little strength I had. _A transaction of mercy, one that only I am entitled to, it seems._ The foul stench of faeces and vomit choked my lungs and seared my eyes as I crawled through the near pitch-black tunnel. _Repayment for a blessing borne from blind luck. _I crawled through the sewage until I was close to passing out until I heard water; and just as predicted, the tunnel forked shortly after. _Is there anything about me; anything at all, that deserves such kindness? Anything… inherent to me? Anything about my person rather than my behaviour that might drive someone to trade their life for mine? What… what would I even call such a desire? It yearns within my heart for a target, but I have never once felt it from anyone else. Love, perhaps? Then, what I desire is not mercy… it is love. If there is no love to be found in life, I will continue my search in death._
