# Black screen, text centered in textbox
In the beginning, there was nothing but a singularity.
From it rushed out the universe.

Countless galaxies stretched and warped across a blank canvas,
as virgin stardust swirled and coagulated within each one.

As did space begin its flow from the cup of God,
so did time.

Of the many miracles time's perpetual march wrought,
life was its most magnificent, but also its most ephemeral.

Life gives stardust warmth.

Blesses upon it love and grief.

Arms it with intelligence, and the means to act.

And curses upon it mortality.

It is but a short respite from the still silence of the cosmos;
a blip on the chronology of all that there is.

We live like bubbles in the wake, surfacing momentarily only to dissipate once more into the ocean's tide.

To exist devoid of meaning or purpose is a burden too great for any soul to bear.
It dulls the mind and grinds down the soul to dust.

Perhaps this is why it was not designed to be unending.
Perhaps the desire to live beyond death is what romances and fascinates the mind more than life itself.

The universe permits that much; for the dust that forms us never disappears.
It may transmute, relocate, or lay dormant for unspeakably long,
but it can always construct and reconstruct life once more.

All that remains is for us to find our way.

Even as my body is ground and dissolved in the frozen dark,
even as I wander blind through the storm,
my remains shall find their way to you eventually.

I need no compass for I have faith.

I need no vessel for I have time.

If not in this life, then the next.
And if not in the next, I will live as long as it takes.
For if there is one thing that lasts longer than time itself,

it is my boundless, eternal love for you.

ch2

I am a speck of metal lost in a galactic ocean.
Beyond this window lies space unbound. There is neither light nor air nor life save for myself.

There are, however, stars, strewn across the void.

My breath has begun to fog up the window, so I wipe it clean with my sleeve.
My reflection sharpens: black hair made long and unruly by an eternity in cryosleep,
and eyes blue and still like a lake at peace.

These are the eyes of someone long since forgotten by a world long since extinct.
Even I have forgotten my name and my place in this universe. All I know is the knowledge installed into my mind when I wakened.

To search for a new home, seed it with life, and watch as they flourish.
That was my mission, and the mission of the hundreds of souls aboard.

_oracle "Preparing for final approach. Begin landing preparations immediately."
The ship pitches gently. I make my way towards the bow, taking care not to bump into the dials and instruments
mounted to the walls.

An aging but nonetheless secure bulkhead opens as I approach, permitting me into the cockpit.

Its size befits my station as a lone pilot:
claustrophobic with panels and instruments on all sides within arm's reach,
and just large enough to serve as my coffin if things go awry.

Through the narrow windshield above the dashboard I can see a vast blue sphere streaked with wisps of white and masses of brown.
This is the planet Oracle deemed most suitable for life, and it is on this planet that we would live once more.

However, the time I spent in cryosleep had eroded my memories to nothing.
My mind is an infant, force-fed the knowledge of an adult but with its innocence still intact.
This would be my first chance at life.

I strapped myself into the seat and lowered the harness.
The planet's colossal size bears down on me as Oracle guides the ship into the atmosphere.

(I wonder... if my planet was this large too.)
(And how my past life went. Even if I knew... it would seem like somebody else's life, not mine.)

(And with how long it's been since I left, surely there's nothing left of past me.)
(My planet might not even exist anymore.)
(It'd be nice if I could preserve it in my memories, but I don't remember a thing...)

The ship begins to shake violently, its reinforced belly burning through the thick atmosphere.
My vision rattles, but I keep my eyes openâ€” so I may sear the sight of this planet into my mind.

The windshield turns white, blanketed by clouds.
The severe deceleration anchors me to my chair, draining blood from my eyes.
I struggle to shake off the gentle shadow smothering my sight, but my neck is pinned to my chair.

As I teeter on the precipice of consciousness, the clouds disappear and give way to the world beneath.
Oracle engages the VTOL thrusters to slow our rate of descent, and my vision gradually returns.
I gasp and sputter for life, struggling to regain my bearings. The cockpit feels oppressive and suffocating all of a sudden.

"Oracle, draw the blinds!"
_oracle "Certainly."

The hull above and beyond the windshield retracts, revealing glass beneath. A means to extend the windshield.
Beneath me stretches a deep shade of blue, stained slightly indigo by the night sky:
a vast, undisturbed lake that mirrors the heavens above.

The moon stares back at me, resting peacefully upon the water's surface. 
It gives chase as I fly past and towards land.

Mountains stand guard in the distance, their frosted peaks reaching into the clouds.
The sandy shore quickly gives way to rolling fields of long, blue grass.

(Is anyone out there?)
(Is anyone watching, as I make my descent?)

(It's been so, so long... So long that I cannot remember how long it's been.)
(So long since I last met a living being.)

(It's as though... I'm the only one left.)
(Alone on a strange planet, forsaken even by my own memory, but not yet by my own humanity.)

(Nobody to hold me accountable. Nobody to be responsible for.)
(It would have been trivial to disable Oracle and go back into cryosleep,
leaving the ship to drift idle until our collective demise.)

(And yet, I feel myself being tugged along by the invisible strings of fate.)
(I cannot fathom how far they span, or how long they have guided me here...)

(But without them, I might have chosen death instead.)

(Perhaps this is telling of my weak, feeble heart, but...)
(Mine is one that cannot beat alone.)
