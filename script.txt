# Black screen, text centered in textbox
In the beginning, there was nothing but a singularity.
From it rushed out the universe.

Countless galaxies stretched and warped across a blank canvas,
as virgin stardust swirled and coagulated within each one.

As did space begin its flow from the cup of God,
so did time.

Of the many miracles time's perpetual march wrought,
life was its most magnificent, but also its most ephemeral.

Life gives stardust warmth.

Blesses upon it love and grief.

Arms it with intelligence, and the means to act.

And curses upon it mortality.

It is a short respite from the still silence of the cosmos;
a blip on the chronology of all that there is.

We live like bubbles in the wake, surfacing momentarily only to dissipate once more into the ocean's tide.

To exist devoid of meaning or purpose is a burden too great for any soul to bear.
It dulls the mind and grinds down the soul to dust.

Perhaps this is why it was not designed to be unending.
Perhaps the desire to live beyond death is what romances and fascinates the mind more than life itself.

A limerence that burns unto death, targeted at its bearer.

The universe permits that much; for the dust that forms us never disappears.
It may transmute, relocate, or lay dormant for unspeakably long,
but it can always construct and reconstruct life once more.

All that remains is for us to find our way.

Even as my body is ground and dissolved in the frozen dark,
even as I wander blind through the storm,
my remains shall find their way to you eventually.

I need no compass for I have faith.

I need no vessel for I have time.

If not in this life, then the next.
And if not in the next, I will live as long as it takes.
For if there is one thing that lasts longer than time itself,

it is my boundless, eternal love for you.

ch2

I am a speck of metal lost in a galactic ocean.
Beyond this window lies space unbound. There is neither light nor air nor life save for myself.

There are, however, stars, strewn across the void.

My warm breath fogs up the window, frozen against the unimaginable cold just inches away.
I wipe it clean with a silken sleeve.
My reflection sharpens: black hair made long and unruly by an eternity in cryosleep,
and a still blue lake in each eye.

These are the eyes of someone forgotten by a world long since extinct.
Even I have forgotten my name and place in this universe. All I know is the knowledge installed into my mind when I wakened.

To search for a new home, seed it with life, and watch as they flourish;
and to act as a beacon, listening for signals of life.
That was my mission.

_oracle "Aligning for final approach. Begin landing preparations immediately."
The ship pitches gently. I make my way towards the bow, taking care not to bump into the dials and instruments mounted to the walls.

An aging but nonetheless secure bulkhead opens as I approach, permitting me into the cockpit.

Its size befits my station as a lone pilot:
claustrophobic with panels on all sides within arm's reach,
and just large enough to serve as my coffin if things go awry.

Through the narrow windshield above the dashboard I can see a vast blue sphere streaked with wisps of white and masses of brown.
This is the planet Oracle deemed most suitable for life, and it is on this planet that we would live once more.

However, the time I spent in cryosleep had eroded my memories to nothing.
The instructions burned into my mind did nothing to assuage my fetal anxiety at drawing my first breaths outside this metallic womb.

I strapped myself into the seat and lowered the harness.
The planet's colossal size bears down on me as Oracle guides the ship into the atmosphere.

"(I wonder... if my home was this large too.)"
"(How much of it had I seen before I left? It looked small enough to fit in my palm earlier,
but now it spans the windshield completely.)"

"(It almost feels suffocating, as though this magnificent planet is strapped to my back, its weight threatening to crush me.)"

"(My planet might not even exist anymore.)"
"(I can't even remember what it looked like.)"

To forget a dead man is to kill them a second time.
Therefore, I have committed mass genocide.

A billion grey, faceless figures swirl around me,
rushing past in all directions with the roar of a thousand trains at full tilt;
travelling endlessly, as though on tracks chained together in a loop.

Their collective howls of agony, long muzzled by the sands of time,
pierce through the air, finally given form after who knows how long.

Their anguish draws me in and threatens to drown me in guilt.
There is no message in their madness. They have neither demands nor curses.
All that remains is the pure, unadulterated despair of souls forgotten and left to languish out of sight and out of mind—until now.

Save for one, with a face identical to mine.

She reaches out through the frigid storm, her tender arms coiling around my body, drawing me into a embrace.

Our cheeks touch, and my face sinks into her hair.
My frozen soul thaws and flows at her warmth, and my eyes run over.
I am of no mind to question her motives or existence.

All I can do is hold on to her for dear life, my limbs entangled with hers.
In the bowels of the universe, where no light dares to shine,
to be seen in the eyes of another is more than I deserve.

??? "As long... as it takes..."

Her voice! It cuts through the pandemonium, sharp and clear as water wrought into glass.
But before I can draw breath to answer, she is ripped away from me.
The shadows blink into thin air and I am shoved back into my seat by extreme g-forces.

The ship is shaking violently, its reinforced belly burning through the thick atmosphere.
Wind whips past the ship, roaring in protest against our intrusion.
Even the slightest structural fault would put us at its mercy.

My vision rattles, but I keep my eyes open—I am not ready to see darkness again just yet.
For now, I should sear the sight of this planet into my mind.

The windshield turns white, blanketed by clouds.
The severe deceleration anchors me in place, draining blood from my eyes.

I struggle to shake off the gentle shadow smothering my sight, but my neck is pinned,
as though held in place by an invisible hand that could strangle me at any moment.

As I teeter on the precipice of consciousness, the clouds disappear and give way to a monochrome world beneath.

Oracle engages the VTOL thrusters to slow our rate of descent,
and color gradually returns to my eyes.

I gasp and sputter for life, struggling to regain my bearings.
The cockpit feels oppressive and suffocating all of a sudden.

"Oracle, draw the blinds!"
_oracle "At once."

The hull above and beyond the windshield retracts, revealing glass beneath. 
A means to extend the pilot's field of view.

Beneath me stretches a deep shade of blue, stained slightly indigo by the night sky:
a vast, undisturbed lake that mirrors the heavens above.

The moon stares back at me, resting peacefully upon the water's surface. 
It gives chase as I fly past it.

Mountains stand guard in the distance, their frosted peaks reaching into the clouds.
The sandy shore quickly gives way to rolling fields of long, blue grass.

"(Is anyone out there?)"
"(Is anyone watching, as I make my descent?)"

"(It's been so, so long... So long that I cannot remember how long it's been.)"
"(So long since I last met a living being.)"

"(I don't remember anything, but the passage of time... it leaves scars.)"

The ship slows down, quelling the wind and its fury.
All that is left is the coil whine of the ramjets as they spin down,
and the whirring of the thruster gimbals as the ship nimbly maneoeuvres its way towards a clearing.

"(It's as though I'm the only one left.)"
"(Alone on a strange planet, forsaken even by my own memory, but not yet by my own humanity.)"

"(Nobody to hold me accountable. Nobody to be responsible for.)"
"(It would have been trivial to disable Oracle and go back into cryosleep,
leaving the ship to drift idle until our collective demise.)"

_oracle "This looks like a good spot. Beginning vertical descent."

"(And yet, I feel the pull of the invisible strings of fate.)"
"(I cannot fathom how far they span, or how long they have guided me here...)"

"(But without them, I might have chosen death instead.)"

Under Oracle's gentle guidance, the ship descends at a stable rate towards ground zero: our new home.
It is beautiful and pure; unspoiled by intelligent life.

As a habitable planet, surely it must be home to primitive life,
but none capable of seeing me as anything other than a force of nature.

Like a falling meteorite rather than a soul.
Or perhaps they might not even be able to see me at all.

I begin to cry.

"(Perhaps this is telling of my weak, feeble heart, but...)"
"(Mine is one that cannot beat alone.)"
